Works well. Bass is somewhat lacking but is present. Overall pleased with the item.
The quality on these speakers is insanely good and doesn?t sound muddy when adjusting bass. Very happy with these.
Wish I could give this product more than five stars. Lifesaver.
works great
Great sound and compact. Battery life seems good. Happy with this product.
It works well~~~
Alll good
Love clock radio & CD player.  Easy to operate.
Breaks very easily, and takes a while to load music
Excellent gain in radio frequency reception over the stock antenna that came with the radio.
everything I expected for a great price
Love this small speaker with loud volume, great for the beach
works as advertised.... nothing else to really say about it
very good especially for notebooks with micro hdmi and you want to connect it to a computer screen
It does not copy CDR s to USB as advertised. My CD?s were recorded on a Sony machine and properly finalized. They copy on other machines. It repeatedly shows &#34;copy protected wait&#34;. None of my CDR s are copy protected. I do want a machine that will copy my CDR collection to USB.
Did not last long,  Stop working within a year.
Can?t get any simpler that this.  And it works just about anywhere you can find a flat lip or side panel.  Ideally the lip should be at least 1 3/8&#34; for best stability, but I got it to hold decently well on the short lip of my desk top, which is just 3/4&#34;. Because the front hanger piece can be adjusted to hang parallel or perpendicular, (or any angle in between), to the clamping surface, I was able to get the firmest grip on the side of a bookcase.  My best idea, and where I use it now, is attached to the arm of my executive style office chair, near where it meets the chair back.  I don?t knock it with my arm or elbow as I raise/lower/turn in my chair.  It is really a nifty place to stow the headphoneswithin easy reach, but not a cumbersome location either. It is wellconstructed with  good layer of powder coating on the metal.  Hardware looks to be top quality, too. *I received a sample product from Brainwavz.
Wish I could tilt it more up & down, but it works fine especially considering the price. Great price, great product. we?re going to buy another one for our upstairs TV.
Good product, but took a week to receive.
Makes a difference right out of the box. I have 4 mini usb?s. One apple old and one apple new style. I plugged this in and keep it hidden away with all of my bluetooth speakers, headphones etc. Fantastic way to keep things charged .....QUICKLY.. and out of place and organized. I like it first for making me organize everything in place ..even though the super fast charge is a definite plus. Comes with sticky tape to hold into place ...so it doesn?t move around on shelf. Very happy with purchase.
great product, great service.
Great little device if you need to convert micro and mini HDMI to full hdmi and down want to buy new cables. So far mine has been working great. Its small in size so its easy to carry with your computer or tablet. It carries audio like all HDMI cables.
Excellent sound. Good price. Ear pads are less expensive and nonbreathable plastic and not very durable and they?re somewhat uncomfortable when wearing over 1/2 hour at a sitting. These Sony headphones are comfortable and will last longer, but I think the sound of the monoprice headphones is slightly better.

Great Energy Level VI travel charger! Very compact and fast charging. It is the most convenient product I never seen before ! I like it. I am very happy with this seller . Order packed very well and ship fast .Great energy level VI slimmest travel charger . Courteous service !
Great space saving solution for consolidating all your DVDs!
This is less expensive than replacing the battery back up and also the battery fit fine.
Works great, I wound up pairing this with a Sonos Connect, so I didn?t have to but the Connect.Amp.  Puts out enough sound and works amazingly.
Excellent product, performs as advertised.  Receive, read instructions, connect to your audio system with included cables, sync to your Bluetooth device (iPhone 4S), play music, enjoy!  Thank you, enough said.
Excelent purchase.  I recomendm it.
Great quality for the price.  I believe they will last the entire school year.  They do not look cheezy at all.
Good looking over the ear headphones that have a surprising deep bass response. I have noticed new bass notes on some of the songs I have been listening to for years. I use them at work to reduce the surrounding noise. A great value.
Appears to work just great. Used it to connect my LG 55LB6100 TV (which only had digital optical out and poor speakers in the TV), to my Onkyo 8255 receiver (RCA inputs).  I connected the FiiO USB power connect into one of the USB ports on the TV so it only powers on when the TV is on; hopefully this will help with issues I read in other reviews with it dying early from being left on and overheating.
Works great in Charlotte, NC. Received all the major networks crystal clear. Highly recommend :)
This case is perfect for my Symphonized NRG Premium Headphones. It?s small and the colors match the headphones perfectly
We bought this for my daughter for her birthday in July.  She turned 13.  She played it 3 times with the new albums she got for her birthday.  She went to listen to some more new albums she bought and it didn?t work.  The turntable would not turn!!!  I went to replace this item and I was literally 5 days from the last chance date that I had to return this item.  Not happy at all.  Now she is upset!!!
works as expected; well made cable.
Best price and fast shipping. Great speaker. Very portable  nice to carry around. Try it  You?ll like it!!
Great pair of headphones for the price. If you?ve ever taken an overnight flight and had trouble sleeping because of the ambient noise, it?s amazing what a little noise reduction can do. You can use these headphones without even plugging them in, just for the noise reduction. On the other hand, they sound pretty good as well. I found these phones comfortable enough to wear for several hours straight. All in all, a good investment in peace and quiet!
Did not help my problem.
Great product.
Great mounts worked perfectly for my surround sound. ....a must buy
I LOVE THESE HEADPHONES! I am totally satisfied with the sound and the fact that they stay in my ears! They are great...and I love the color of course. :)
Cheap and good
Hard to beat the price. They all seem to work the same and be the same quality, why pay more?
Phones were dead prior to replacing them with these new replacement batteries,
Horrible
I?ve decided to keep the item.  the ezcast is not quite as good as Chromecast with most features, but it?s cheaper and has a couple of features that I actually like a little better than Chromecast (actually works with Firefox for HTML 5 video).  Also, the setup goes pretty smoothly which is a plus (maybe even better than Chromecast).  Just how secure it is remains to be seen.  Something tells me that this Chinese company that manufactures it, lets the device be vulnerable to hacking, but we?ll see.  The support site for the Windows app is in Chinese as best I can tell, and not conducive to North American customers, but hopefully that gets improved soon.
Bought these a year ago and being an active traveler they have held up pretty well. Comfortable for long flights and still have 100% noise cancellation
great products! good buy! works great!
Love this radio. It alerts the whole family when any form of weather changes. Plus you can have one in each room.
Fits my tv perfectly
Enjoy crystal clear clarity sound with this product!  Super great quality! Highly recommended! Would make a perfect gift for anyone or for yourself!!
Bought these headphones a week ago and I love them. These are the most comfortable headphones I?ve ever owned. Feels so comfortable even listening for many hours. I own a pair of Audio Technica M50x and these for me are much better. They are much more open and a pleasure to listen to any music. I listen to music mostly on my iPad and have a subscription to Tidal premium musi service right now. The clarity of the music is amazing. These headphones also are a great bargain at $108.99 on Amazon. I?m very happy with my purchase.
Happy For about 4 weeks using these in the gym. The tips then lost the sponginess and then teared over time. I kept my headphones in a case and yet they wear out when you use them after a few weeks.
I am having a hard time getting the nut tight behind the mount for the monitor. It seems tight, but the monitor still pivots left and right way to easy. I also see lots of people complaining whey they tried to get it really tight they broke the mount.  I have used better mounts that are only a few dollars more. Spend a little more and get a decent mount.
Does the job.
Junk  will play MP3, but not WMA, even though the instructions it comes with says it will.  When you try to play WMA, you get &#34; 34;.  My wife bought for a birthday present, by the time I opened it, I can no longer return it.  Instructions do not match player, menu, like everyone else said, is not intuitive.  To select something, you push &#34;Menu&#34;, when you would expect to push the button in the middle.  Aggravated with this player AND Amazon!
Our family loves to go bike riding but i get bored after a while. I got a free trial of these Taco speakers and took them along one time when i rode for a while. Put on my favorite jam and jammed out to the amazing music.
Item as described , fast delivery
I got these and used them a couple o times to swim. However, a few months after my purchase, I felt that one side was louder than the other. I turned them around and discovered that I?m not the one with a malfunction, but its this gadget somehow looses strength on one side. I bought these to replace my previous Sony Walkman, that suffered from the same malfunction. My conclusion is this: the Sony Walkman NWZW273S does NOT work!
did not support my xm radio it does not produce 12 v dc more like 8.5 v dc. they also have a no return policy go figure.
Solid product no complaints.
Has great features like iPod dock and USB port, but the sound is so unclear. I am very disappointed
:3bdd17778455ef097fcffb1d018022b6]] There is a good variance in Bluetooth speakers, from physical design, extras in the box and sound quality. Not all speakers are worth your time and money. This little Cube speaker by iGadgitz is a very interesting speaker; it may be little but it has big sound and it works very well. I did find one potential issue when it comes to the range of operation that I will describe below. This is one of the smallest speakers I have seen and used. In spite of its size, it is a solid and hefty little speaker, weighing more than you?d expect. In my mind this is a good sign: it means that there is more to this little speaker than a cheap little speaker and a subpar receiver. To be honest I was a little skeptical that it would put out good sound when I first saw this speaker. It has pleasantly surprised me (more on that shortly). This speaker pairs and connects very easily. When it is in discoverable mode it identifies itself as  Xquare 2 . I had no issue with it pairing to my phone and once connected it remained connected without issue. The range on this speaker is good and I have been able to carry it from the source to a distance between 20?  30? before it began to stutter or cut out. I have seen speakers that have more range but the majority of them fall into this threshold. Now, that said I need to mention an issue that came up in testing that should be kept in mind. If the speaker is sitting such that the switch and controls are facing down (that is, the control side is on the flat surface where it is sitting) the range is cut very dramatically. With the speaker sitting that way the range dropped to about 6? before it started cutting out. It did not seem to matter if it was the speaker that was moving away from the source or the other way around. I loaded up some music and played it through this speaker and was pleased with the outcome. The speaker has no problem with playing at higher volume, without distortion or  washing out . The profile is very good too  the bass is strong and slightly elevated but not overkill, the midrange is very good and the music has depth as a result, and the highs are bright and crisp. For such a small speaker, this one produces betterthanexpected sound. This is one of my favorite Bluetooth speakers. It is very small but it has excellent sound and is made very well. The size makes it placeable in areas where other speakers are too bulky to fit. This speaker proves that smaller speakers can have great sound and it?s worth its asking price.

My son gets 41 channels in Hickory NC. He is well pleased.
I bought this as a gift, and the recipient loves it.
More or less.
These are like HDMI on steroids.  Very well constructed cables.  Nothing cheap about them and the price was really good too.  I?d buy more of these in a heartbeat
well, it is a pain to have a odd charging cable and to also remember how to pair it to another phone.  Keep the instructions around, you will need them
So, I wouldn?t have purchased this if it were not for my wife, who is infinitely frustrated with my audio setup. I needed something that would sit next to our TV, and be simple to use.  The fact that this has a remote is a nice bonus.  The fact that this can grab my local radio stations is a HUGE bonus  one which I didn?t know it could do (does it via streaming). My problem is that I have this setup: Computer requests audio to be played from a Linux computer which uses a M2Tech Hiface to stream digital to my DAC (streamed lossless FLAC).  This then feeds into my preamp, and then amp and speakers.  To access the linux computer that runs the whole show, I have to have her use shell login to my linux host (not easy for most people, and if something goes wrong, she can?t fix it).  You can then  from command line play pandora or music. So, those issues being stated, after plenty of research, I chose this.  I can connect this up right into my preamp, and she can use it pretty easily.  The setup was a snap, follow a few instructions, and I?m now linked up with my pandora account (I?ve got probably 40 stations I?ve been grooming for years).  Great. I had mistook the &#34;antenna&#34; in the product pictures for a coax hookup for an AM/FM antenna.  In fact this hookup is for the antenna to your wireless router.  Very fortunately, this nice box has the great feature of being able to pickup any radio station that streams their broadcasts (which as it turns out, is almost all of the local stations).  Not only that, but I can get stations that I would otherwise not be able to get at all (since I don?t rely on an antenna, just whatever I choose to stream).  how do I get my local stations?  Simple !  you just set your location (enter your city I believe).  And it?ll select the right stations for where you are.  It will also allow you to then progress outwards and grab more stations that you wouldn?t otherwise be able to get with an antenna of probably any size.  I live in Baltimore, and it allows me to get stations hundreds of miles away!  Very slick!! The one downside to this product is that the builtin amplifier is really pretty poor quality.  However, I didn?t buy this for that functionality anyway.  I only ended up using it, as my preamp crapped out, and I?m stuck using the built in amp for the time being.  It?s nice that it?s available, but don?t think that if you have decent speakers, that you?ll get very good sound quality.  You?re much better off using the ?line out? and putting this into your favorite receiver or preamp, as the built in one just isn?t so great, but it?s functional.ith an antenna of probably any size.

Awesome earphones! The sound is great and the ear pieces are very comfortable.  I use them at the golf range.  They are lightweight and don?t fall out of my ear when I?m in motion.  Best of all, NO TANGLES even after being shoved in and out of my bag.
Day 20 November 2014 acquired the JBL portable load Indoor / Outdoor Bluetooth Speaker | Black and hardly used it and 6.16.15 she has stopped working. Just take full charge when left more than 24 hours, yet their working time is no more than 2hs. The few times I used, was always loaded with accessories that accompanied it. I live in BrasiliaDF Brazil, not with the product warranty or aq even there in the USA. She when turned on, provides a noise as if in short circuit and after a while for the noise. only is working connected to the charger.  It is expensive and that left me high and dry.  Disappointed.
I?m really not qualified to review headphones, but some members on headfi gave them really good reviews and so far they?re the best I?ve had or used. They?re extremely clear, and while somewhat lacking on bass, you still feel and hear it it?s just not overpowering. Listening to these headphones is akin to the experience of eating Dark Chocolate.
Watched a video on how to install it on YouTube and it was easy
I was very dissapointed with the quality of the headphones they sound very low the battery dies in less then 2 hours which I find ironic because they are not even loud. The range from your phone to the actual headset is probably only like 2 feet because it disconnects everytime I got my phone in my pocket all around upset about the product especially for this price I could?ve bought any one of the 30 or 40 dollar headphone and it probably would?ve been the same or better
Replaced a Logitech wireless radio with this in my bathroom  sounds so much better!
Exactly as described. The sleeves have helped to &#34;tidy up&#34; by work space. Thanks!
Good for the price.
They work
:46129030a61a028dbd8e69c13b30606]] Please watch the video for more specifics. I enjoyed using this Bluetooth speaker from TaoTronics. You should wet the suction cup or else it will not stick very, once you do that you should be fine. The audio is very clear the sound is very good overall but the bass may lack a little bit due to the size which is to be expected. I found it interesting the typical double tapping of the phone button is not how you call the last caller, instead you must hold the button down which is different than what I?m used to but something worth noting. It takes approximately two hours to charge after which you can expect 56 hours of playback from the 500mAh battery. When the battery is low it will beep to indicate that it?s time for it to be recharged The included user manual is very clear and very easy to read. The charging ports is well covered so no issue there with water. As you remember to wet the suction cup it will actually stick but if you do not it will probably only stick for a matter of minutes I found. You can?t submerged in water completely obviously but splashes here and there shouldn?t be an issue. Review sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review.
:ca7421903fd1ad5c64ae1dc42a160649]] Earbuds have always been an issue for me. Mine is one of those stereotypical stories  I can?t find a pair that fits my ears well. I?ve tried so many types of earbuds and most of them give my ear canals some sort of fatigue. It?s not that they sound bad, just that keeping them in my ears for more than 10 minutes is painful. The only ones I could tolerate were the Apple EarPods, and I have a love/hate relationship with them. Sure, they sit nicely in my ears, but them being fully open means I lose my music to the crickets of night and pelicans of day. Well, no more! I found the Flare R2A inear monitors, and seems my fear of earbuds is over. Disclaimer: This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. The R2s began their life on Kickstarter with a campaign that raised over $170,000. That?s quite a lot for IEMs, which are a rather niche market. Flare is a British company that strives for excellence in sound, and hopes that the world can join them in this pursuit. Before the R2s, the company made loudspeakers, so inears is a bit of a different industry. I think they did a fine job of things. I listen to a lot of different genres of music, but mostly folk and dream pop lately. To test out the R2s, I listened to hiphop, jazz, EDM, instrumental guitar and piano, rock, classical, and of course the aforementioned folk. They performed consistently well in every genre. They also look great. First, of course, the sound. These IEMs aren?t active noise canceling or anything fancy, which is good because noise canceling often diminishes the sound quality. The R2s are still great for keeping outside noises to a minimum. They use the same plushy foam tips as earplugs, which makes for a comfortable and quiet listening environment. I tried them at work, in the bus, walking down a busy road, and even in a studio while recording. There?s absolutely no sound leakage at all, which is great for quiet environments, and none of the quality seems to be lost when the environment is noisy. People sometimes rant about flat response and how it?s better than everything else. Those people might be troubled by the R2s. They?re warmer than most earbuds, but don?t have muddy bass. The main issue with earbuds is always treble: there?s way too much of it everywhere. Then Skullcandy wanted to have fun so they started adding a bunch of bass to the mix. Everything above 80Hz seemed to have been lost. The R2s have none of those problems  highs are crisp, mids cut through well, and the lows of course deliver the muchneeded punch, rather than a drone. The responsiveness of everything is very tight. As I said before, everything I listened to with these IEMs sounded wonderful. They revealed details in songs that I didn?t know were there, while also being comfortable, affordable, and easy to use. The highs were not overbearing, but pronounced; the highmids don?t clutter the highs at all; the lowmids keep all the bass lines in check; and the lows make sure you remember that the bass drum exists without making you forget about the guitars in the midrange. That?s a great achievement. I really love the way these sound. Everything is balanced. Overall, it?s a bit warm, but I would much rather it be warm than sound like tinny old Apple earbuds from the early 2000s, with their mesh and bassless muddle. On to the design. These things are beautifully minimal, but aren?t trying to be artistic, which is nice for a change. The earbuds themselves are black (or whatever color you chose), and the tips and cable match that. There?s also a rectangular machined aluminum box that splits the stereo signal for the left and right channels. It doesn?t need to be as big as it is, but it does add some pizzazz to things. Lastly, there?s the 3.5mm connector, which on mine is black with two gold stripes running through it. I love the design, but there?s one ergonomic inconsistency: The aluminum box. It looks cool, and I can see why the designer would have put it there. However, if you want to use these as a versatile pair of IEMs, you may walk with them once in a while, or just move around a bit. The latter is inevitable, and when you do choose to move around you?ll hear some strange thudding sounds. That?s the box attempting to defy gravity. Every time I hear this I tell myself it?s cool to look at, but doesn?t need to be so heavy and certainly doesn?t add any special functionality. The heaviness, I suppose, adds value to the IEMs. I would just prefer it wasn?t here, especially when I?m using these to perform. While these are  reference  series  at least according to the marketing by Flare  I don?t recommend using them for referencing. The R2s don?t produce a completely flat sound like Sonys do. They?re amazing for listening to, but not necessarily for studio work. I tried mixing a few song using them just for fun, and I noticed that most of my mixes tended to lose the lowmid range on other speakers and headphones simply because the R2s are warm. This characteristic is great when listening to music, but not for mixing/producing it. If you?re a musician, you?ll find that these are great for monitoring (and thus they are named inear monitors). I used them to monitor my vocals and piano while recording an entire song and they worked great. The warmth helps make things less straining on the ears, and there?s not so much bass that I get a headache using them after a while. I also used these to monitor my synth and the rest of the band while playing live, and the foam tips isolated the sound very well. It?s worth noting that since these are inear monitors, there is no microphone. The aluminum block in the middle of the cable just acts as a splitter  there?s no hidden microphone. At first this bugged me, because I would receive a call and forget I couldn?t use these headphones to talk. After a while, I just accepted it. There?s no reason for IEMs to have a microphone since there?s no way for you to use it as a talkback to your band or anything. It also goes against the way that Flare built these, which is to solely focus on recreating sound accurately, not adding more sound. Bottom line: A microphone would have been useful, but there isn?t one, and that shouldn?t be a deal breaker. Here?s the verdict: The R2s made me like earbuds again. I was considering the Shure SE215s, but these reign superior. Once they?re in my ears, I don?t feel like I need to take them out. They feel at home. Even Apple?s EarPods, which  sit  in my ears nicely, don?t make me forget that I?m listening to music through small pieces of plastic in my ears. The R2s do, and they don?t look ridiculous like some earbuds. My friend even told me he didn?t notice I was wearing them because they?re so small. That?s awesome.e the design, but there?s one ergonomic inconsistency: The aluminum box. It looks cool, and I can see why the designer would have put it there.

Nice sound for what it is ? a small Bluetooth speaker.  Syncs easily with my iPad.  Good clear sound, decent bass.  Sounds great on talk radio stations.  Nice little unit for the price.
Battery is much improved from earlier models.
Excellent!!
Hold TV very secure.
now they tell me you can?t split optical audio
Sorry, this cable worked for about a week then broke. I had ordered others before and same result. My fault for thinking things would change. Thought I had gotten a bad set, but that is the rule...not the exception. I?ll try the more expensives ones from Bose.
The sound quality is unbeatable.  I can?t handle turning the volume as high as it can go, it is really a great system for any size room
Really cool design and it goes up really easy.  The amount of adjustment is really nice as well.  It?s been up for almost two months with our 55 inch TV and hasn?t moved as all unless I?m the one to move it.
I ordered one, Loved it.  So I  gave the first one to my husband who was traveling for a month and ordered another for myself......wouldn?t turn on after charging.  Returned for another one...same problem.  GRRRRRR!
Works great!
I purchased the OUS000563 Super Thin Indoor HDTV and took it to Barbados where after installing it(simply tape to concrete block wall) I was pleasantly surprised by the difference in reception of the TV. I highly recommend this product.
The only batteries I buy for my DSLR Cameras.
Loved it
I was unable to use them because they hurt my ears I used them for a total 30 min. and my ears felt like they were bruised.
Product arrived in good packaging and worked well.
The Speaker worked great.  After about 5 months of periodic use, it would not power on.  Omaker sent me a new speaker free of charge.
First off, I bought this product on sale for $25 off of Amazon. What a great deal, this bluetooth speaker is LOUD! It?s got fair bass levels for the size and price point. Both front and back of the device emit sound, though front is louder. I think this gives it better quality and more range. I use this out by the pool and plan on using for fishing trips and tailgates. The only reason i did not give it 5 stars, when pressing the volume +/ the music stops for a &#34;boop&#34; noise. Also, when powering on, changing modes, or pairing a device, the speaker plays a womens voice that sounds almost comical. It?s a little goofy, but at this price point who cares. This speaker is comparable to high end units of the same size, with just slightly less bass. Thanks Amazon!
Very good speaker
Just bought my second and third one of these.  The first one backs up a desktop computer and monitor and easily runs it for 15 minutes after a power outage.  The new ones are to power my cable box (Comcast) because even the briefest flicker of power and the box goes through the whole five minutes restart procedure.  The other one is just for the modem/router/VOIP/NAT devices.  We don?t lose power very often or for very long periods of time but keeping all those devices from resetting and rebooting is worth the price of these inexpensive UPS devices (paid $45 each).  Batteries are easily replaceable and about $17 each for the generic brand.
Wonderful wonderful product, don?t think it could be improved I used for motorcycle trip long continuous wear 14hr days cross country in comfort no wind noise and better than a pair of custom made ear gear I had with for comparison.
The turntable do not work correctly.  It was dragging!  Otherwise, the sound and other features worked well!!
LOVE IT !!!! WILL PURCHASE MORE IN THE FUTURE  ; )
Exactly what I was looking for  an inexpensive, light set of phones for listening to Pandora on iPad
Awesome product. Super fast delivery.
The rather small but I guess if I read the description better I would?ve noticed that.
It works! I got a muscle cramp, rub it on the area nd the pain was gone within a minute.
I use this all the time now.  Works great, battery lasts a long time, great sound.
Does the job!
As Advertised
I really enjoy the the skip and pause functions. Only things I would change is being able to adjust the volume on the speaker itself, and for it to have a better stick, had trouble getting it on the shower. But it was loud enough and easy to use. So ultimately happy with it.
Great product.
great item
Bought Dec 6, 2014 and worked great until today... Now, the charger no longer charges and will not power the unit with the battery slide switch in OFF position. Checked the charger with a Volt Meter to be at 12.5 Vdc even with a 10 Ohm power resistor connected to it. Which means that the problem is in the Max A34. Not very easy to take apart as everything is glued with a soft glue gun. Now it is an expensive paper weight. Doubt 1 year warranty is worth anything, but will look into it. Cannot recommend this product based on this experience.
Too expensive & reception is not great. A $10 antenna does the same job.
I bought this 10 days ago. It was relatively easy to hook up. The autocalibration took a few tries to get right, but I was pleased with the outcome. The sound was fantastic and really enhanced the viewing experience of my new Sony 4k 70&#34; television. Today it died. I was watching Band of Brothers, and halfway through episode 3 the sound just died. I did my own troubleshooting (I have an advanced degree in electrical engineering) and then called Sony support. They ran me through a few steps, and then escalated me to another department. After being on hold for 40 minutes, the line kicked off and said that the office I was trying to reach was closed for the day. So I am now 10 days into a three thousand dollar investment with Sony, and I am watching a football game with no sound while I type this. My receiver was a poor product. And the support line was awful. I am not happy.
These do not hold as long of a charge as the greencapped compeditors, even though the MW/hr is advertised to be higher.  However these do work as batteries and will hold a ?decent? charge, however the charge is shorter lived than other batteries of the same type I have tried.  I do use these often.  Also these did fry one of my USB ports, so use ONLY in outletusb ports.
A nice aid to fasttuning the MP1 80, 60 & 4010m coils.
Good sound... stays in place when running
I am loving the product! Comfortable fit. Good sound.
These headphones are amazing!  The clarity is unreal.  I would highly recommend purchasing a pair!
Perfect fit. efficient.
great
Ordered to hookup a backup camera. This thing has different connectors on each end. I had one end hook up OK but had to find and RCA male to male adapter to make the other end right. I am not sure why they thought it was OK with differences from one end to the other.
Use this everyday at work..  Great noise cancellation.  Wonderful product.
great quality for the price
Comfortable, but terrible sound. Very tinny, with no bass at all.  I would return them and ask for my money back if I could.
Great product, sturdy, works like a breeze and came very handy for my rack (attached picture). The two front receptacles are great when you work with a laptop in front of the rack and need to charge it, including your cell phone. I chose this version with and Amp meter, even though it still shows zero dot zero, but that?s because I ended up plugging in very light applications like cable modem, IR repeater, USB fan, etc. Otherwise, if you plug in a hair dryer for testing purposes, you will start seeing the amps come up. So it does work, and very well. It is only a few inches deep. Few tips: always leave some space above or below the unit, so that if you plug in AC/DC adapters (those that come with small routers and modems), you will have enough clearance to plug the adapters in the back. Otherwise you can always buy those very short NEMA extensions to clear the path (http://www.amazon.com/C2GCables03114OutletExtension/dp/B0002J1KRQ/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1440983975&sr=84&keywords=nema+extension). On the negative side, I wish it had come with an ON/OFF switch in the front...
For a speaker its size the sound and volume are great. I would recommend this little speaker
You won?t be disappointed. The only draw back is that you can?t change out batteries
I was not too that I needed another part to make it work on my new Bose radio not happy with the lack of information
As described. Just what I wanted
Great sound quality for the price, LOVE the matte finish and no logo. Great business model and exceptional customer service.
work great at the right bprice
Trash, returned mine after 2 days. The pads are hard and very uncomfortable. It is completely plastic  and feels like it is  about to break. DONT BUY
This had pretty good sound, but would not fit on my bike.  It requires you to have handlebars that are straight for at least the length of the speaker.  I didn?t want to bend the cheaplooking clips too much, either.  However, the reason that I returned it was because it refused to charge out of the box.  Plugged in, it sounded rather nice, but that?s kind of pointless for a bike speaker.
Work great with my Jaybird headphones
Great product.
Works fine for my application. Range is not the best but fine for my use
this fits exactly i expectede.
I like it
I bought this as a replacement for my Verizon FIOS backup battery. The original battery lasted over three years... this one lasted 8 months. The &#34;Designed for long life: 6  8 years&#34; statement is a joke. I finally contacted the company after a week of trying (even after a year, their website listed on the battery is not working) and they offered me a replacement, however I had to ship the battery back to them first at my expense. To pay $20 to return a $23 battery for replacement is ridiculous, so their &#34;3year replacement warranty&#34; is absolutely worthless.
great for iPhone cable, earbuds and plug.
I bought this to replace a lost neoprene case for my QC20i earbuds. This case is just ok. It seems very cheaply made and it?s kind of hard to use because the zipper is a little stiff. If it was more expensive, I would have returned it but there?s really no point (I?d get a buck or two back after return shipping).
This player is an absolute fraud. the system is horrible to use you cant play playlists. its just a cheap knockoff, I hope apple sues them. I want my money back...
Installed and I was able to pull up all the public channels. To determine what this antenna will pickup you will need to plug your zipcode into the following site that will list available public TV channels: http://antennaweb.org/  The site takes into account terrain.
This product worked just as advertised.
Work good but could be better. Clear sound.
I bought one of these radios from BiMart about 4 years ago without listening to it (the selection was very limited and I was in a big rush). I would not buy it again. The sound is tinny, it has no automatic shutoff (a must for me), and the station tuning knob makes a huge change with only the slightest turn of the knob; that shortcoming drives me nuts. I use it only on camping and hunting trips to receive the Weather Service weather reports and as a backup for my Sangean AM/FM portable radio (love that one). I never could get it to work with the hand crank; maybe I am not doing something right. I have several other Midland products (CB, FRS, GMRS radios) and they are all pretty good but Midland fumbled the ball with this one.
Fast shipment, easy to install  no issues so far.
I put these in some VoIP/SIP Cordless Phones (Yealink). They really do hold their charge well.
Such a great option to extend those HDMI cords, instead of buying a super expensive longer cord. I connected 2 ten feet HDMI cords with one of these and i have not noticed any reduction in quality. This has allowed me to connect my PC and TV that is up on the wall.
Excellent for my child?s dorm room
Good unit...sturdy...easy to mount and at a value price.  What more could you ask for?  I recommend.
I like this device.  The sound is clear and it carries well.  It is so convenient to carry only this speaker.  I can use it through wifi or I can plug it in to my laptop and play my playlist.  It has a rechargeable battery and lets you know when the battery is low so you can plug it in and charge it. I am pleased with this purchase.
I have ordered 3 packages of these over the past few weeks and all of them have been different sizes. The first 100 fit perfectly with about 1/4&#34; overhang at the top, I like that compared to the other sleeves that usually hang 1/2&#34;3/4&#34; over the top of the record. The second 100 I received were cut incorrectly and I couldn?t even get the record inside of them. I sent those back and reordered, when the 3rd shipment arrived they fit perfectly but some of them are cut too short and don?t even reach the top of the record. This would be a great product if the company had better quality control standards, as is I won?t be using these in the future.
Only lasted a few months then blew out.
Quickly located the signal and connected.  Very surprised with the sound from such a small speaker.  It?s strength is in it?s size  easy to move around.  Redefines portable music.  Perfect for the deck, patio and pool.
this is worst, I test it when i got it since it arrived very very late..I charge it up within the 4 hours of charge time and tested it, it ok and then the next day it just malfunction/stop working till now..so this is just a garbage..
Have a Panasonic plasma with side inputs and this helped hide the cable perfectly. Nice tight fit in connector as well.
Love it
When I bought this speaker, I had one request.... I want to be able to wake up to the music of the Harry Potter Intro in mp3 with a soft wake up (volume gradually going up (which I emulated in audacity)).... Which I recommend to anyone with a relative light sleep, it really is magical. Anyway...the mp3 alarm is not reliable... worked fine for 3 days then doesn?t start I don?t know if it?s related to the way you previously stopped the music....unclear.... The screen is also way too bright (and quite small) to be used as a clock in a dark room (I put papers on top to soften it a little bit) I tried all buttons and buttons combinations to fix my alarm problem and nothing worked.... only unplug, turning off, turning back on fixed it....for one day....
When I see another component stacked on top of an amplifier, I ask myself  Do you not realize by blocking air movement, you are causing any amplifier to get many times hotter than it should. Effectively reducing it?s lifespan considerably!
Good sound quality.
This thing kicks buttttt!
Fell apart
My wife loves her new head phones.
I?ve tried 2 of these and both screens failed in a year.
better than expected
good product good seller
after a lightening strike wiped out my old receiver along with my music streaming devices (Grace and Roku) I was looking for an all in one 2 channel receiver that would stream internet radio, play Pandora type services and stream from my 400GB music database.  After researching on line, I bought this unit. It arrived today.  Set up was easy. It took longer un untangle the rats nest of old wires than to set up the new unit.  I connected my wired network and started to play around.  The sound quality is excellent!  The choices of inputs are excellent as well.  The one great shortcoming is the display panel.  I cannot understand why Yamaha would put 1980?s technology into this otherwise modern, high quality system.  It has a one line 13 character dot matrix display for alpha numeric messages, such as track name, station id etc.  beyond me why they cut this corner. What saves the day is the app.  Yamaha NP Controller allows you to pretty much do everything from your android or iOS device.  The app is smooth, fast and intuitive.  Ps: do not download the Yamaha AV Controller App as it does not apply to this unit.
Easy to use, good sound, great battery life, very portable, exceptional value.
I can?t get it to work!
Product was defective but the customer service was fantastic..
Good quality Good Price!
just what I needed only used one but do have more things to use on
Fairly sturdy, all metal construction, it did come with wall anchors, screws & straps to secure it upright if you need to do so. No missing parts, and the fit & finish are very good. Instructions are very basic, but it?s easy tool free assembly means a 1 sheet instruction page is fine. As the shelves are adjustable to wherever you want them to go, you may have extra shelves leftover depending on how and where you place them on the poles.  As I migrate my DVD collection to BluRay, I?ll shrink the space between shelves and add the extras later. Overall, very pleased with this product at this price point.
If there rca speakers don?t buy!  I?m not huge on fashion so my vizio sound bar rear speakers just got tie wrapped to the back of the pole and clipped pole is solo small it will fit speaker wire only! And probably small gauge only
I appreciate my speaker, it?s loud and clear
Great product to save money!  Product as described!  Fast delivery!
It?s only been in use for a few weeks but so far it works fine. It was well priced and arrived promptly.
wasnt as loud as expected
Product is just okay! Volume level is not very good, I am used to going louder. Charge only lasts for maybe 2.5 hours of continuous use. This is my first pair of bluetooth earbuds. I feel gullible because I was going to purchase a pair for around 20$ and I thought the price point was too low so instead I purchased these. I think maybe for a tryout pair I could have gone with the 20$ pair.
No problems with using for its intended use.
Worked great at the cabin
Great batteries,  highly recommend them.
Looking to replace my iPod before it completely dies. I could not deal with the UI so I returned it. meant to by the newer version of this device but I am certain that was my fault.
While cord was shorter than I would have liked (3 ft.), The product shipped quickly for coming from China and works fine.
I really like these headphones. Great excess noise canceling. comfortable to wear 5+hrs/day. Microphone works good. I only rated 3 stars because the microphone just stopped working. Ive used this 15 months with no problem. No accidents, no visible reason for it to stop working. Im really bummed. only recommend buying if you are fine with fact that it may only last 1 yr or so.
Great charger.
Did not work as expected, However this might be an issue with my application and not the part itself.
Good Quality. Good Price.
It worked perfectly for my Samsung 46&#34;. It?s affordable (I paid $15.66), has a great quality and it?s easy to install! I?d recommend it.
Awesome speaker! I take it everywhere. Charge really lasts. Sound is great. Range is fantastic. If you?re in the market, get this one.
Fine item.  Best reception I?ve had since DTV became a reality several years ago.  Picked up more channels that previous antennas.
exactly as promised.
Nice design and works well in tandem with the bought ear phone.
1.The exact colour as the picture. 2. Easy to set up especially for a beginner. 3.I like the fact that I can also use an aux cord for songs I don?t have on vinyl.
Best table radio ever, better than my Bose.
these have good bass, but at the same time, even as a basshead I found these to be a bit boomy, they almost have nothing but bass. I did however get them to sound great with the use of the PowerAmp App on my phone, but for the most part, it is honest difficult to find a good spot with the equalizer and if using it with a device that has no PowerAmp app, it will continue to sound boomy. the highs and upper mids are much quieter in comparison. the ear hooks in my opinion are uncomfortable. I really wanted to like these headphones, but they were just too &#34;high Maintenance&#34;. I felt like I was working too hard to be happy with them, I want something that sounds and works good out of the box. the customer buys and uses, they don?t work to make the product meet their expectations. for these reasons I decided to return and Went with the Jaybirds Bluebuds x. They are more Portable, come with a hardshell case in comparison to the cheap mesh bag included with the photives, feature better battery life, sound better, and are far more comfortable. For me, it was worth it to pay the extra money, I hope they are durable enough to hold up, but only time will tell.
gets every hot
Installation is doable and the cartridge and needle work. Four cables attach to it from the shell, and it took some persuasion to push them on. Needle seems to have a slight angle (to the side, not the needle in the groove), but does play without ruing the LP.
Well, I purchased this Masione? Surge Protector Strip 2500W 6 Outlet Black Power Socket With Lightningproof last week and since it arrived, it has changed names and has changed the description now not mentioning surge protection. I?m not sure if my computer and $200 router are safe with this outlet strip. It provides power and is compact. I chose it for its straight plug which was needed to go into a recessed floor outlet but wanted something that had surge protection because of its use under my desk.
Gave to husband and he likes them.
Great quality of the product and service.
I was so happy to get this little case, we have a DVD player in the car and I?m tired of having an endless array of Disney & Dreamworks DVD cases stuffed into my console.  Quality is good, the plastic sleeves seem like they will hold up.  The case is more rigid so it offers protection for your very valuable collection of the Planes series DVD?s.
Great product at a fair price. It was easy to install and has worked out just fine. I would recommend this product to another customer
didn?t really help with cable clutter
Bearly open up the package and only 1 headphone works great.
As I expected
Changed my life.
Very good built quality. I use this screen with a pocket sized projector and everyone is impressed with the utility value and the set up. The screen is perfect for a meeting where it is not possible to use a large screen. This screen fits inside my large suitcase and set ups in a snap. My colleagues were so impressed, they ordered it as well after seeing it.
Cord tooooo long and plus not cl
I bought these as a gift so I never wore them but they looked a little flimsy to me. I would not personally buy them for myself.
great product for the price.  TV works great and the picture quality is really nice and clear.
Nice player. A little difficult to learn how to power off but getting better at it.
Use these in my RV on windows and doors for a bit of added security.  Stay put and do the job. Great Seller!
works great
I usually love cranking up the bass in my car stereo once i get a new car. After receiving a free trial of the TACO speaker well i don?t have to crank it up lol, the bass sounds amazing. Every song with lots of bass i can think of sounds amazing through these red speakers.
This product works well. My only complaint is that the plugin cord is a little short to use on my bedroom TV. I ended up hooking it up in my son?s room. It was able to give it just enough boost he no longer has to move the antenna around to get the channel he wants. Installation is super simple. Basically it?s a plug and play. Or better yet a plug and watch. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
Works great. Had it quite some time, use it every week. Wish it had the functionality of the older one.. but what can you do when Sansa doesn?t make it that way. Thanks!
So far so good.  Will update if anything changes.
Use along with the colored ones I also ordered.
Quality construction.  Small but heavy construction.  Works very well with my record player.
Love the fact they are only three feet!  Does not take up so much room behind TV
Ok storage
fit perfectly
Was exactly what I needed
performed as expected
Easy set up! Us it on long rides while training on road bikes. Only had a short time, but happy with purchase so far1
Good product
Best headphones I?ve ever had for this price.
USELESS AND BROKEN...Didn?t even get to use it once.  Just utter poo quality.
I love these headphones...they are alot better than skullcandy
I bought these for my boyfriend, and they work for him because his ears are much bigger so the loop fits, although the sound quality is still just mediocre.
Great HDMI cable with signal amplifier built in. Make sure you run the cable the correct way as it is directional. I have used this at multiple locations.
Gave as gift to my son.  He liked all the fuctnions.
A little loose on me and they?re not adjustable, but decent sound quality. Be careful of the headphone jack as it seems to bend easily.
I am extremely satisfied at the quality of these especially for the money. I was in need of longer headphone extension cables and these have not disappointed.
Great speaker, especially for the price.  Use it as an alternative to a computer monitor speaker.  Keep it plugged into the monitor & computer, has great sound and I can take it with me whenever I want to.  Great buy
I bought this adapter to stream my music from my Samsung Note Edge smart phone to my Nissan Murano 2014. My 2014 Murano doesn?t come with streaming music so I had to figure out a way to listen to my music on my smart phone. My car does come with a DVD audiovisual? adaptor so I was able to use the Monster MusicConnect Portable Audio Player to connect my phone to my car and it works awesome.
I have 2 different things set up on here and it switches according to what is turned on.  No problems at all.
POE didn?t run through it. I had to shorten it up 25 feet for it to work. The pairs are hardly twisted. In the end it worked for what I intended but it wasn?t worth my time cutting and recrimping an end on it.
Great. I like the triple flange ones even better.
Fits and functions perfectly for my printer. Not much else to say.
Ok but wouldn?t buy another pair. Maybe a different model. I had a different model of Bob Marley headphones and absolutely loved them. I thought I would get the same out of these that a got out of my last pair but was disappointed
I bought this speaker  two months ago and have waited to give a review. I have been very pleased with the performance. The sound is quality and louder than what I expected. good buy. Thanks to the reviews before me.
It?s a battery that does what it is suppose to. Why are you even wasting your time reading reviews for a cell phone battery? It?s OM and works. Problem solved.
great
Great for running!
Thanks
Took a few days to get here but worked like a charm.  Was easy to install with detail Phillips and flat head drivers.
Either the batteries or the charger, can?t tell,
excellent product!
One unit was broke off on arrival. In fact all of the liquid head spilled during shipment.
My only knock against these is that they don?t fold up into a very compact bundle. They take up more room in a laptop bag or travel backpack than you might think. But if you have room for them in your bag, these work GREAT on the airplane and you?ll definitely be a lot less frustrated at the crazy amounts of ambient noise in Economy. I had a baby screaming behind me and I was.... chill. It?s like having your semiprivate room on a plane. Of course it?s not nearly as noiseisolating as the more expensive headphones but if you need a budget option these are great!
it charges batteries
Great product.  Recommend Highly
my daughter love it
It works great. Love it. The suction cup fails a lot tho.
It works just like it is supposed to
This speaker is amazing. It pairs very easily with it?s built in Bluetooth. It?s volume range is great, It?s larger size allows for bigger speakers and the bass sounds great, Went camping with this bad boy and it was a hit. I use it at work for my employees 4 days a week and it?s battery after a year is still holding a great charge. Don?t hesitate to buy this bad boy, my friend felt bad for wasting over $100 on a Bose portable when this guy blows it out of the water.
Not sure how long they?ll hold up, but they definitely have a good sound. And at this price, even if they last a few months, they?ll meet my needs.
as advertised
Excellent sound quality for both music and other A/V application (movies, TV, etc.)
works just fine
Arrived promptly and as described.
Love this product. People I travel with end up  using it too as it has so may outlets and ports.
These headphones are a hit or miss. I?ve ordered 3 pairs  the first one lasted a while but inevitably broke after years of good service. So, I ordered a second pair. No bueno. It literally went bad on the 2nd listen!! I procrastinated calling the customer support number the headphones came with and eventually lost the little piece of paper, so I ended up buying a 3rd pair hoping the bad luck with the second was just a fluke. The 3rd pair lasted literally a week before  it too broke. Basically, only one of the headphones receives sound  regardless of what the headphones are plugged into. No matter if it?s a computer, a phone or something else  only the headphone opposite of the mic works  which is quite inconvenient. To make matters worse  half the time the sound quality of the working headphone is horrendous. Overall, I really regret giving JLab another chance and buying from them. Their newer models just don?t work.  Not sure what happened to the quality of their products, but it?s crazy to have 2 different pairs of headphones stop working almost right away! Beware!
Charges batteries fully, much better than any of the small chargers or onboard chargers on my devices
This is a nice little turntable. Don?t expect great things from the speakers, but it works well, and is fine for my records.
Very good cable, super fast delivery. Highly recommended.
Working. Arrived on time.
Got this for a slick price. Both strips work great, the power cable is kind of short, but works great.
Great sound.
Thank you
Would be great if it worked.  I got it and have tried it in multiple locations and checked my wifi strength at each.  It constantly loses signal and tries to require.  I need to keep going back through the setup and then log back into pandora it is so much easier to put an old phone or cheap tablet in its place and the work soooo much better.  I wanted to get a large group of these one for the front one for the back and two or three in the house but at least the one I have is so spotty on its antenna I will not get and more of them.  Possibly if you are using it with a wired connection it would work great but my needs were to use the wifi and that is terrible.
I don?t have much to say except if you?re looking for a small BT speaker, buy this one! PROS: Decent sound quality (but not $200 Bose as expected) Works as speakerphone Quite small Battery is amazing, charged it 30mins one time and lasted forever CONS: Cheaper plastic housing
Works fine
died on me only after a year of use, ridiculous, and I used it very little...will be contacting sandisk and amazon to see if they will warranty but probably won?t.....
Incredible sound! Fills a room. Crisp, rich sound.
Good, I can see clear my TV after 100 Ft.
This boombox played one time, and then wouldn?t work at all afterwards. We tried multiple CDs and they spin, but don?t play.  Really disappointed the 4 and 6 year old kids who it was a gift for. Find another boombox if you want one that actually plays music.
Didn?t use in wall, but they hang with a lot of other wires. I didn?t want any interference from the other wires. Isolated well and great sound.
Great sound from such a little speaker!
its an excellent product fits just right since my new displayports on the right of the monitor instead of the bottom its exactly what I needed.
First pair of headphones I ordered came half broken. No sound coming out of left earbud. Did not matter on the song. Hoping it will be just a defective pair. Will update when replacement pair comes.
The only bad part about the head phones is if your using them via Bluetooth there is a flashing blue light that is not very noticible in a lighted room but in the dark you notice it in the perifirall vision.  Other then that they are perfect sound is good and if you don?t have them at max volume the sound wont leak, way before you even get sound leaking out it gets more then loud enough.
This product works great despite severe hearing problems.  I can?t imagine it not being able to wake someone between the very loud alarm and the vibrations of the pod.  Easy to use and there are adjustments for the loudness and tome of the alarm as well as a dimmer for the LCD brightness. It is a bit larger than we thought it would be (perhaps I didn?t check dimensions before ordering) so be aware this is pretty big for your nightstand.
Using these on an IPV Mini 2 at 50 watts for about 3 months now and the batteries are still going strong
Lot better sound than the radio shack we had easy to setup for area
Bought the Blue Ant Pump HD Sportbuds three months ago.  They won?t turn on anymore.  Manufacturer?s website fails to give any instructions on how to fix this problem.  Sound quality was average. Nothing spectacular.  They don?t fit as snugly as others claim.  External noise interferes with the listening experience.  Wouldn?t buy these again.  Don?t waste your money on these.  Look for something more reliable.
The flat cord I used twice and it already quit working.  I have a cord that I paid about 10 bucks for at a gas station and it has lasted 5+ years and this thing doesn?t last 2 hours...... oh and wait now I can?t return it because its been 30 days.  Do yourself a favor and buy something else from someone else.
Sound is excellent! They cancel out a lot of noise, but not all noise, which is what I expected.  A great pair of headphones for a reasonable price!
No problems with this item
The price to quality ratio on these headphones is fantastic. I do have occasional trouble with the microphone when on the phone though; although sometimes the microphone performs fantastically in difficult conditions.
Working great but sometimes it just flashes and doesn?t work. I don?t know why it does that but when it works, it works great.
Bought this for my uncle and he loves it.
I purchased a couple to protect antenna amplifiers in my attic.  I like the compact size and they have not let me down.
Wow! Big and heavy. Lots of pieces, but assembly is a breeze. Very well designed, and everything fits nicely together. Not all solid wood, but you can?t really tell. Best piece of build it yourself furniture I?ve ever put together.
Here?s the quickie... 1. Cool LCD screen that shows the status of all the batteries. 2. 4 cell charging is done with a timeshare system where only 2 batteries are actually being charged at the same time. 3. It can charge LiFePO4! 4. Cooling is a bit of a problem (for in depth, read the whole review) 5. Overall this is a charger with a good warranty. If you got a flashlight or ecig that goes through batteries like a mad man, this is a good candidate. Full review: The looks: The Nitecore D4?s outer appearance is quite amazing. The curves tapers off the edges leaving the charger with an elegant look and feel, not that you will be holding the D4 like a phone watching the bars slowly move up. Since when it is fully populated with 3400mah Panasonic 18650?s this D4 becomes a brick, a charging brick? The usage: The D4 can charge pretty much any battery you can find, with the exception of the 9v. (I wish Nitecore made a 9v battery adapter...) For the lithium groups, you can either have it cut off at 4.20v for Lithium ions/IMR. Or if you have LiFePO4?s you can have it cut off at 3.60v. The charger can?t automatically detect a LiFePO4 from a Lion battery, but all you need to do is hold the mode button until it switches over to LiFePO4. FYI, Holding the MODE button also puts it into &quot;Low&quot; speed charging, but keep holding it and it will switch over it LiFe. For NiMH and NiCD batteries, the D4 uses delta Voltage and delta Time (dV/dt on the LCD), the D4 measures the change in voltage over the change in time to detect when the battery is full. **********Charging 101********** Lithium batteries: When charging a lithium battery, you use a constant current (CC) to bring the cell to a voltage of 3.6v/4.2v/4.35v. When the max voltage is reached, the processor of the D4 will switch over to constant voltage (CV) and it will wait until the current drops below a certain amount. When that current is reached, the D4 cuts the power supply and it will show the &quot;Charging Finished&quot; icon. On this particular charger, it doesn?t do a continued float charging where it keeps the batteries topped off. So that means if you leave the charger plugged in and powered, after 1 year the battery voltage will be lower than the charge voltage, but the charger will still say &quot;Charging Finished&quot;. The same goes for all &quot;common&quot; Lithium batteries in all shapes and sizes. Notice I wrote &quot;common&quot;, so no charging LithiumAir or Lithium perchlorate batteries in the D4? Just FYI, Lithium batteries when over discharged will be damaged, because the cathode and anode of the battery will be destroyed and cannot be reverted back to its original state, thus losing capacity on a massive scale. Over charging Lithium batteries can be catastrophic, because the cell will heat up and go into thermal runaway. (When the battery selfdestructs, like a diesel engine burning motor oil, runaway diesel). It?s quite fascinating how lithium batteries symbolize our own DNA. Every time they get charged, their ends are damaged a little bit losing capacity just like how our DNA loses its telomeres every time it replicate. For NiMH/NiCD batteries: The D4 uses a ?Delta Voltage over Delta Time, or in English, the change in voltage over the change in time. So when the D4 receives a dead Eneloop AA for example, it will begin to supply power and take down notes of the time. It will also start a virtual graph with slopes, plotting down many voltage measurements along the time axis. So now you have a timer, memory, and a virtual graph. Seem quite complex just to charge a battery right? Without going too deep into the charging algorithm, let me finish off this off. When the processor detects a sudden drop of voltage at the terminals, the charger will terminate the charge and call it complete. Becauseof the close relationship of temperature and voltage in the chemistry of the battery, having a thermal sensor right under the battery is not necessary. **********END CHARGING 101********** The bads about the D4: The thermal design of this charger is horrific. Despite the timeshare charging system, it still uses mosfets with close to none heat sinking. I had to make custom copper heat sinks and fill the whole charger with thermal pads. Although we are at a state in tech where even at 100C these PN junctions still operate happily for a while. But for longterm durability, the heat created is never good. I can safely say that the charger will last a good year or two, but with that amount of heat produced, you can question the efficiency of this charger. Granted, it only uses 12v 1amp, 12 watts, but it is only charging at 1400ma (750ma x2) @ 4.2v. Bottomline is this charger is a must have, if you have Skyray kings or Supfire m6?s. Even their own TM06 uses 4x 18650s. I have had this charger for almost a month already. Gave me no problems, I have charged all my Eneloops and my whole collection of unprotected 18650?s, 32 of them! I this was a review that I wish everyone could write. I paid for the charger out of pocket, and I love it.e relationship of temperature and voltage in the chemistry of the battery, having a thermal sensor right under the battery is not necessary. **********END CHARGING 101********** The bads about the D4: The thermal design of this charger is horrific.

Works Great
I got this so I could connect a blueray player to my old analogue tv.  Picture is a tiny bit fuzzy but not bad.  I unplug this from electricity when not being used since I don?t feel safe leaving it and it?s power converter plugged in all the time.
Excellent connection excellent fit excellent price!! Am extremely happy with this product
Best headphones I have found at this price. Use it as my basic.
Happy with product
Great item at a great price and fast shipping!
very satisfied with stereo
Fantastic Auxiliary Cable! Best I?ve ever bought!
Does a great job for what I want it to do, and the fact it?s zippered makes it a breeze to put in.
I think this speaker works well. My husband likes it so much that I don?t get to use it often.
The main reason I picked this clock was because of the time projection. I was leery about it because I didn?t think I would be happy. But, I?m glad I went with this one. My deciding factor was the advertised aux input to use it as a speaker (others did not say that was an option). It arrived quickly and was pretty easy to set up as well. The actual clock screen is able to be seen by me (a wearer of glasses) from where I lay about 8 feet away, and I aimed the projector across the room near the ceiling which is about 20 feet and I can see it perfectly. Neither light is overly bright but is still able to be seen without strain.
This was exactly what I was looking for. I am terrified of storms and thought this would be perfect to keep with my emergency supplies, which is was. I haven?t had to test it in an emergency situation yet but the radio works great. It also has a flashlight on it and a port to charge your phone or usb devices. You are able to hand crank it for power so if you was to run out of batteries this would be the perfect back up for you. I am very pleased with this radio and very happy I had the pleasure to test it. I received this product at a promotional price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review
Perfect fit on my 7506s. Look and feel great too.
Works great.  Bought it to go with the steering wheel pictured here.  My son loves it!  Takes about 2030 mins to assemble.
These worked fine at first, but now I have no control over the volume. It turns down on its own every time I plug in my headphones. Its so frustrating. And I?m very disappointed
All was good, but it was missing the case.
I was a loyal, happy X1 user and when it broke I found AudioFlood.  Superior technology?compact and fits on my goggles perfectly. Especially good if you want to listen to blogs, audio books, etc. Highly recommend this product!
It is working very good. Just missing the format button.
This does not work. Do not buy it. And they will not refund or accept returns. It ships from China. Total waste of money!
Yes  exactly what I expected!  Thanks
Very appropriate. There is no problem.
Probably the best earphones ever. Better than the Apple ones, I just wished that it had a mic on it, but these will last you a long time. Just ordered my second pair (since my first one got stolen) I had these for about 5 months and it still was in good condition before someone took it. Definitely would recommend and continue to repurchase these. Also, fast shipping too.
works great
Very awesome quality and smooth clean sound coming through, I?ve been using this 25 foot version to connect my TV?s audio out to my stereo system that?s set up against an adjacent wall in my living room. Very sturdy connection points and a very sleek look and feel to the material used in the construction of the cables. Clearly visible colored indicators for left / right feeds. Thanks guys! note: I received this at a discount for my honest and unbiased review
Great little radio.  Has good audio quality.  No AC adapter jack so it?s good that A pair of Dcells lasts for ever.
1. The display is too bright, even on the lowest setting, for something you want in your bedroom at night. 2. The snooze button actually only engages the snooze mode. You have to dial in the minutes on a second knob and then hit a third button to execute. Other clock radios have a single button that you hit and forget. 3. The preselect buttons are not lit, nor can you distinguish them by touch. Other clock radios have buttons and controls you can see or distinguish by touch in the dark. In addition, my unit is finicky: (a) It gets lost trying to buffer the stations, all while my other mobile devices are having no problem getting wifi from the same location. (b) Either the power supply input jack or the start button fails. I fiddle with them and the device eventually turns on. Finally, ten preset buttons is hardly enough.
Cute, Fun, let?s folks know how classy you are!
Works great!
This iPod is perfect for my needs.  Great customer service.
It works! Teenage son is up. It also vibrates. Phrases are funny. batteries are included. I don?t know how long they will last but it is nice not to have to find an outlet.
It works as advertising.
I like the Lonve, but I was disappointed because it?s not comparable to my 8.1 windows so I haven?t been able to download music to it. I have only been able to listen to the radio.
Works great! As described
bought this product to replace my transmittor that was lost its a big scam
sounds great!
This is a common battery scam that I see on eBay, and I?m sad to see it on Amazon as well.  The current maximum capacity for a 18650 size battery is 3400mAh with a maximum rated current of 6.8 amps.
The remote didn?t work on my TV like it said it would
I got this as a free trial but i really thought these would be crap speakers. I was so happy when i decided to use them. The sound fills up all my house and I can really relax after a long day.
This is an OEM remote that allows ALL the TV?s functions to be used. This remote arrived ahead of schedule, at a good price and exactly as advertised. Thanks.
Works well with Skype on my TV.  Full HD was a plus
After a number of returned products by other manufacturers  this one is a delight. Easy to set up. Sound  even from MP3?s is spectacular. Should have looked at this one first.
I just got these boxes and they?re great!  They come flat, but snap together super easily. I?ve filled them with DVDs and VHS, and now what once covered a large shelf and drawer of my entertainment center is consolidated into three boxes sitting next to one another on just the shelf. They look nicer than I expected, and especially for the price. They look stylish and definitely helped organize some of my chaos. Worth the money!
Best for the money period. Don?t hesitate.
What can I say. The Status Classic headphones are a miracle. The quality of the sound is up there with the very best on ear headphones but these are a fraction of the price. They are so good in fact that I have already preordered the HD Two?s. If I had to find some fault, I do miss having volume control on the cord, but at this price that?s really just nitpicking. Well done!
Great little speaker. No problems. I would recommend this product
It works with third party no name brand PS2 turbo controller, very good little adapter.
The lens color is backwards on the glasses I received.
It only lasted one month working good. After a strange noise that appears,  I could not hear any. Maybe because of the price, no wonder.
I bought these to replace a different sony pair that I lost. The sound in these is awesome and well worth the money (don?t waste an ridiculous amount of money on expensive ear buds like bose). As a plus I am able to skip/pause songs, answer calls with the button on it and it even has a mic! The red color is a plus, I always bring these with me in the gym.
Works well, I receive about 30 stations that are local to my city... broadcast towers about 10 miles away.
Not a good product. Looses network constantly. Audio out seems to have a mind of its own! With volume all the way down, will occasionly drive full volume of a screeching noise! Ruins speakers. I expected better for $1800. Also, no customer support available. No phone numbers and web based tech request has gone unanswered.
Replaced the battery in an older UPS unit and it worked fine.
worked great and arrived on time. Very happy
It does it?s job very nicely. It?s 50ft worth of a HDMI cable and it does exactly what you?d expect it to. I?ve included pictures of the cable in case anyone would like to see what it looks like.
Good enough for noisy surrounding like in an airplane while makes it possible for you to hear what?s going on.
Replacement for my grandson?s ear buds. Price is right.
Great headphones, I mean they aren?t going to blow your mind or anything, but they really work perfectly for the price you pay and for what they are .. these work so nicely for me when I?m trying to do some work and need outside sounds blocked out and I just want to hear the video I?m watching or the music I?m listening to.
Backup battery for my garage door opener.  Larger wiring connector worked on the smaller terminal size on one side.
Great speakers, arrived quickly
Sound quality was pretty good. I only used these for running and sometimes around the house. Reception was ok, but when running sometimes it would cut out. I synced the headphones to my phone which was carried in a runner?s belt around my waist. My runs were usually an hour or 90 minutes. Besides the control box bouncing off my neck, these were the most reliable Bluetooth headphones I?ve used so far. The reason for my return is what happened the past two Sundays in a row. Both Sundays my runs were longer 2+ hours. Both times the headphones were fully charged the night before and both times the headphones battery died at exactly 2 hours. The description says 6+ hours listening time on a full charge. Clearly that?s not true. Being returned and so begins the search again for small, reliable, long battery life Bluetooth headphones.
The people who are reporting fit problems on the MCX male side aren?t crazy. The product photo shows a series of tiny vertical relief cuts around the outer conductor of the MCX male connector that provides a kind of springiness that allows the male connector to flex slightly and then grab onto the internal components of the MCX female connector. Well, my pigtail was manufactured without those relief cuts. No amount of pressure will allow the male connector to be inserted in my NooElec RTLSDR dongle, because there is no flex whatsoever. Needless to say, I am disappointed. Every photo of a MCX male plug that I?ve found online shows those relief cuts, so I assume they?re part of the spec and this was just a massive screwup by quality control. Maybe other people?s MCX female ports have more flex to make up for it, but the plastic case of my RTLSDR dongle won?t even allow the rim of the male connector to pass. So now I?m stuck between drilling out the plastic case of the dongle and hoping for the best, or using some kind of tool to slice two vertical slits in the connector on the MCX male port.
Works great
The cord is too short, less than 2ft. Pay $6 more dollars and you can get POP with 4ft cord.
I love this little speaker.  I use it for when I?m floating in the pool and it?s not too loud to disturb the neighbors but I can still hear my music and relax.  It also seems to go quite a long time in between charges.
Works great.  Paid around 15 dollars and that?s a great value. Good sound, good signal strength, good battery life.  Bought 2. Have had each about 3 weeks.  Use daily!
Decent pair of headphones if you just want to watch shows/movies, but other than that the bass sounds really muddy with any music, but oldies. The headset didn?t really fit my head it was sort of tight but that depends on your head so in the end I give this product a 3/5. Note * one of the pairs I bought had a broken button,the headsets are cheaply made* (you get what you pay for)
As Advertised
Best purchase I have ever made!
Used with: iPhone 4 The round housing, often called &#34;gamer?s earbuds&#34; is the key element in giving big BEWM BEWM bass (thus the appellation &#34;gamers earbuds, ?cuz we like da pew pew BEWM).  The wood housing, like any wood body instrument, creates additional resonance  though prolonged use will get the best and warmest response as the wood goes through a breakdown process, just like a wood body acoustic guitar. Highs are very crisp, as well.  I do prefer a mellow overall spectrum, yet I did finally find a decent Virtual EQ on the Apple Store that toned that treble right down, and boosted the bass even further.  BEWM BEWM... big bada BEWM. Oh ya, big sound from an economical set.  Complimentary product provided for evaluation, yet my thinking here reflects all my personal purchasing decision processes, and hopefully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations.
I don?t have Dr Dre beats so I tested these on a normal pair of ear phones and I must say that they were a bit fiddly to fit but then once I had worked that out, they seemed perfectly ample for the job in hand. The reason I have only given them 3* is because they are being advertised as a replacement for an expensive set of earphones and I don?t think the quality is brilliant and i don?t think you would put these on expensive headphones. But for a cheap and cheerful replacement for a set of cheap earphones, then these are ample.
Perfect
Brackets worked great for my new surround sound speakers.  Nice quality with optional hardware.  Very impressive, didn?t expect suck a nice product for such a low cost.
I live 35 miles from our local station towers. I live in a valley with the mountains near by, no large trees in the way and was still unable to receive any signals...
It is a nice little speaker. Wish it was a bit louder.
The sound is great, but I think the flat wire is a bit too fragile.  It does not have a volume adjustment, but allows you to answer calls, so it is ok for the price.
Good quality! Works great
I was really wanting to convert my durable 3.5mm iPad cord into a right angle. So I found this connector that I thought would do the trick. It does ok but doesn?t seem to have secure connectivity. It is sort of easy to come unplugged. So I have just gone back to not using it.
excellent
I have purchased two of these charger.  One was purchased for my wife to avoid confusion over charging requirement of various devices.  The charger turned out to provide a great deal of convenience.  She uses it for an iPad 4, iPhone 5s, iPod Touch, Nook Glow Reader, Samsung Nook 7 inch tablet, Motarola Bluetooth headset and an Auxiliary Chargng Battery.  Each of these charge without any issues.  After approximately three months I purchased an additional one for my use.  My use is about the same as above with a Sumsung Rugby phone instead of an iPhone.  There has been no problem with any one or combination of devices.  I believe the iPad 4 has the highest current draw of all of the devices.  I have noted a 200mV drop in output voltage at approximately 2A load.  That of course is undesirable but within spec.  I spent to many years in power supply development to completely ignore that but also except it.  I think this product should meet the requirements of most users both for home and travel.  I recommend both the product and the brand.
awful alarm clock. blue back light doesn?t stay on and batteries run out very quickly.
So far so good! I haven?t used it long enough to say its a 5 star item, but quality seems good,and sound is good. Got it very fast,so service and shipping was certainly good.
Perfect. Justa what I was looking for. Excellent service.
Good price.
The picture quality is garbage. And the second screen barely works and the speaker?s don?t work. I would like to find the person that sent me this garbage. Or Broke Garbage.
A+
Works.
These were advertised to be for JayBird BlueBuds X but THEY DO NOT FIT. Zero points for a wrongly labeled Amazon posting.
GOOD TOOLS
Terrible sound! This might satisfy a grade 3 student, as intended, but I even doubt that claim. The sound is like a child screeching, actually. Way too high in pitch, even with the &#34;tone&#34; adjustment. Classic cheap plastic Chinese workmanship to boot. Stay away. Has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with the vintage Califone?s. Thank goodness I bought this locally in NYC from a reputable store that enabled me to promptly return it hassle free.
I found this hard to use.  The buttons are placed in awkward positions.  I ended up hitting wrong buttons several times, which made it difficult to set the clock etc.  I like that it shows the temperature, but I still couldn?t make it work for my needs.  Easily returned.  Good customer service.
This little unit packs a great sound and seems to be very durable.. great price for a great product
Works as advertised. Good Job. Watched a Two and a half hour Blu Ray movie using this device, no problem at all, quality was great.
I love them for their price and quality.
Although a great idea, I couldn?t get the plug to turn while on vacation.  The outlet was set sideways and my hands weren?t strong enough to work it.
Great sound system. Haven?t tried to put it on it?s max but so far it?s good. Also, you must turn off the TV volume so it doesn?t create an echo.
This was very easy to mount to my TV. It comes with 3 different ways to mount (on the wall, on the TV with adhesive, and on the TV with clips). I mounted it on my TV with the clips and it works much better than it did sitting on/in my TV stand. The remote signal is much better. I no longer have to aim the remote right at the Roku. I also did not want to use adhesive or screw into a wall, so the clip option was the selling point for me. I recommend this product.
These work great! I need to buy a few more because we burn through batteries so fast. The best rechargeable I?ve ever used.
Cables are sturdy and the right length. No signal problems.
Marvellous for our UK voltage electrical equipment. Quiet and effective.
Does exactly what I needed it to! I have an older Infocus projector which is not HDMI capable. I initially connected the projector to my DirecTV receiver, and received the error regarding HDCP issues and was stumped on how to bypass it. I searched around online and was led to this powered HDMI splitter. After reading some mixed reviews about whether or not it would work for bypassing HDCP with DirecTV boxes, I gambled and ordered it. As soon as it arrived today, I went and connected it to the DirecTV receiver, then to my projector via a HDMI to VGA adapter and I now have a working projector again! I also was able to run it through my receiver which is HDMI capable, and then out to the projector using the same HDMI to VGA connection and it works like that also! I am so excited and relieved that all I need was this splitter!
These work perfectly.  It was the only way to connect my Tivo Mini to the component connections on my somewhat older (but at the time, higherend) tube TV. It?s amazing how good the picture still looks on that screen!
This is a wonderful cable, especially for the lowcost.  It functions perfectly with great picture quality and clarity.  Because it is coiled in the packaging it takes a little bit to make the cable straight and not &#34;twisty&#34;, per se.  But, that is to be expected and straightens out quickly.  This was a great buy, once again, from Amazon and I will be buying again in the future.
Badly made product.  Cannot listen to CDs without stopping to reinsert CD..  I would not buy this brand again.
Really pleased with the ear cups. Has totally change all aspects of the headphones. For me, there has been an improvement in the upper frequencies, but most dramatically has really opened up the soundstage. Sounds totally different to what I had before. Comfort has also improved, now I can hardly feel them when on. And at a price much less than genuine replacement cups, these items are probably one of the cheapest ways to improve the performance of your headphones. Love em.
perfect
I thought the laptop was dead, but it was the power cord! What a money saver!
worked great just like it should
Bought this as a gift for our daughter.  We tried it out at the beach and it worked beautifully!  The sound was great.  She is very pleased with it.
Fantastic
I purchased 10 of these batteries. At least 34 of them do not seem to take a charge after one use. I would never buy these again.
Works as it should.  I like the NFC built in, as it enables you to use taptoplay if you set it up on your device.  Sound and range quality seem good so far.  Reliable and seems to have plenty of battery life.  I bought refurbished.
Very light and slim.  Everything as advertised.  Great price and fast shipping!
The sound is great.  However, the control buttons on top don?t respond when pushed.  Not to big of a deal, but it would be nice if they worked.  I never contacted the seller to resolve the issue.  Shipping was fast and over all an easy transaction.
Speaker stopped working after a while. Now the static has gotten a lot worse. Can?t even stand using it everything sounds like s***. Not even a year old. ugh.
Second time I purchased this cable, Twice now they tear around the edges. Will not buy again !
I had one of these for a about a year and it worked great for that time.  It went bad, but I was fine with that as it is not expensive so I ordered two more so I didn?t have to change out my app tv and direct tv hdmi.  The two new ones both work, but you must unplug the HDMI and the power, then by sequence plug in the HDMI then the power cord back in every time you want to use it to get it to connect to apple tv or the direct tv.  Once I do that it works great, but it is getting frustrating every time I want to watch TV in my bedroom.
I like this product however users should make sure that it is not combined with an antenna that is preamplified it may cancel out your signal. At least that is what happened before I changed to an antenna that was not preamplified. Afterwards my channels came in crystal clear!
This is the worst remote we have ever had. The buttons don?t work. It looks like it has more options, but it very frustrating to use. I?m love technology and would not recommend this to anyone
These are amazing. I have always loved the portability and bass of my skull candy earbuds when you get a good seal but I have trouble getting the right fit. with the rubber tips it seems like the only way to get them to not fall out, while also getting good bass is too jam them into your ear pretty good and at that point, you have pushed out all the air and can feel almost like a suction that is putting tension of your eardrum. Not with these! I read about these while looking at the reviews for the Jaybirds Blue Buds X, I ended up ordering them along with a set of these, I can?t tell you how happy I am with the setup. I don?t even use the little wing tips or whatever you want to call them. roll these just like a normal foam earplug, and quickly place in a comfortable spot in your ear, hold for around 510 seconds and listen to your music. The highs are good and mids are good, and with the perfect seal you get with these foam ear tips, you get great heavy bass. but it is CLEAN. its not muddy, exaggerated, it is very present but in the cleanest way possible. Get the right fit and then head bang for an hour and I would be surprised if you managed to get them to fall out.
Best choice out of the varying options we were given by socalled experts. We chose this and my inhouse geek is the happiest. He gets to play with new channels we never had; and, channels we always wanted to have but because of cable contracts...well, you know how that goes. Free at last! NO MORE CABLE!
The size is perfect for what I needed. Speaker is nice and clear, but I wouldn?t expect anything else from Klipsch. I would buy this again without question.
Works great, can play 4 or 5 with them in my xbox 360 controller.
This little MP3 waterproof player is absolutely fabulous.  On a recent trip to Rocky Point, Mexico, I used this little baby every day.  It performed beautifully in the salt water of the Sea of Cortez.  Even when it got covered in sand, I rinsed it off and it was ready to go!  The only complaint that I had is that my kids were fighting to use it, so I?m going to buy a couple more of these so I can have this one to myself.  I highly recommend this little device to anyone who needs a waterproof MP3 player for a great price.
The radio would not pick a station close plus it would play 95 fm when it was on 89.3 fm not worth the money it?s junk
Great sound, took awhile to figure out all the adjustments, no issues with pass thru, pass thru works even if receiver is off.  Now I just need new speakers.
Works Perfect.  All HDMI channels work and audio is great through all speakers.  Set up was a snap with the auto calibrate feature.  I would recommend this unit over Pyle any day since quality is more assured with Sony.  (Bought a Pyle receiver first but had to send it back for being defective.)
excellent product. worth every penny.
It?s a cheap MP3 player and not the most intuitive to use.  I got this with the idea it was cheap so I don?t need to worry about it.  Sounds good, works with my truck stereo, and if I loose it or break it I can get a cheap replacement.  Works great for me.
good product
Good, loud sound for non critical listening.
Good buy. Saves me from having to buy batteries for my microphones all the time. They can loose their charge if not used for some time, so make sure to charge them ahead of any use.
So glad I found these, a life saver after I lost one of mine that fit good.
Fast service , works great. Thanks
So little bass and tinny sound.  Have to return.  There must something wrong with them.
It works as stated
Work great and are reasonably comfortable.  Good value for the price.
Does all it promises to do.!
Worked great
Exact fit resulting in an easy install. Quick ship.
Works great
It is fantastic produce. Recommend to purchase it.
Love, love this record player. It arrived so fast and was packed great! Put it together in less than 2 minutes and started listening to my records shortly thereafter. It?s a great bang for your buck. This is not a fancy, high end record player, but I have no complaints, plus the array of colors, mine is orange, is great and should give that pop of color to your decor! Highly recommend it.
I bought this warranty to go with a replacement bulb I bought for a Mitsubishi television. When I tried registering my product, the website wouldn?t recognize my purchase
My Kindie needed headphone w/a mic for school. I was told by the teacher that this was one of the better set that the kids brought in. They are perfect for my little guy and his school needs
The clock works as advertised. Descent construction and large and bright enough to see 68 feet away. I use mine in a TV stand and keeps good time and good looking.
works great
Generally, I?m a huge fan of Antennas Direct. My family has bought several of their products, including: a C4, a C2, a db8e, and this VHF retrofit kit. To pull in a VHF station that is 43 miles away, we bought this kit that is listed having a range of 2550+ miles. Aiming directly at the towers, I got 0% signal, even without combining the antennas, mounting this directly on my mast. Customer support at Antennas Direct says the range is good for 35 miles MAX. If they had written that on the product description instead of the confusing &#34;2550+ miles&#34;, I probably wouldn?t have spent my whole afternoon on the roof. This is a great solution if you?re looking to add short range VHF to your signal downlead. Watch out for medium or long range, it might not work. It?s just a pair of dipoles. If you have line of sight, you might be ok on longer range
Nice cables with a firm connection.
This worked well throughout my trip to Korea. I was on a 10 day trip and a number of us had the exact same one  everybody reported success. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was due to the following: a) the price as a bit high in my opinion (I paid over $45. I think this is more like $29.99). b) it didn?t really charge my phone that fast. I tried multiple different ports to charge it but all were fairly slow (like overnight for a full charge). All in all though I am satisfied. I would buy it again. And I do plan to use it on future travels
great
I got this player for free, but it took so long to receive it, I forgot how I got it for free.. Anyway I have loaded it with just one cd for now. I charged it for about a day and a half, and it still will not play,( the red light never did go out). I took the headphones and tried them in another device and they work, (although very low quality). I went online to see if there was some kind of a manual and I was unable to find anything. I keep going back and trying to get it to work because it?s perfect in size for a lot of different times I would like to use it. All I can say is it?s a good thing I didn?t pay for it. I know it?s only about 5 bucks, but, junk is junk, don?t waste your money!
As sportswear headphones, they might be great while skiing or something, but they should not be in the sleep headphone category as they are not comfortable to sleep with.
Quick shipping. Good quality.
works perfectly with my sony xbr 850c.  thin, light, cheap and easy to pair
Cute colors and pretty great sound considering how little I paid for them :D I?m happy with my purchase
Horrible design.  Difficult to install by yourself.  Screws that fit weren?t long enough.  I?ve bought 4 different tv mounts, and this was by far the worst.  Difficult to attach and remove tv when necessary. Can?t turn tv on an angle much because it?s so close to the wall, maybe 15 degrees.  Spend the extra $10 for a better one. Ultimately,  the mount does its job, but would never purchase any design similar again.
I was very plesae
It?s good.  I like the way it looks.  40mm sounds good!  It does came from Japan and came before the arrival date given by the seller.  I like the product.
Some screws were missing, but had some extra screws laying around to make it work.  Other than that, they work as expected.
Excellent quality. It sounds incredible. Great product.
I really like these a lot.  I skateboard and do not like the in ear canal style earbuds that tend to be the dominating style.  I?m glad I was able to find a good pair in the style that I like, the only change I would make is to make the cord slightly shorter, but too long is definitley better than too short, so for my uses these are almost perfect.
Very nice
Great sound from a small package. Highly recommended.
Sounds good. I like it. Thanks
It?s smaller than I thought it would be but, battery lasts a while and it?s much louder than it looks like it should be.
One of thee BEST product Apple ever made. Have no idea why they would discontinue it. I guess the new law is: People don?t want you to buy what you want. But what they?re giving!
Perfect,well built and strong. loved the price!  Will order more.
Does a great job. Thanks
No reception 20 miles from station.
It works well no need to have so many wires all over your house just for this antenna good quality image ????
I love the length of the cord.  That is great.  But it doesn?t really charge very well at all. I plugged my phone in at 3% and had my maps app running and my phone died because the cord does not provide enough charge. I will be getting a new cord.
Great sound quality, and loud too. The bass ROCKS and yes, it is water proof. I was down at the river and my dog came out and got it soaked. Still worked perfectly fine afterwards. Great prodct, and worth the money.
Cheap wire. NOT oxygen free copper.
All arrived in good shape thanks
Not bad for the money but I did have to go to the hardware store for some extra bolts to make it work.
We have been able to receive 19 channels with this antenna.  The installation was easy and we have it mounted on an interior wall. We live in a wooded area at the bottom of a hill but near the city so I was unsure the type of reception we?d receive. However, the reception is great...unless the weather is poor...  Only downside is the adhesive strips provided with the product aren?t strong enough to hold it to the wall. You?ll either need to nail it or add more strips. overall, perfectly pleased though!
Overall it works great and performs almost all the needed functions of six individual remotes. The one problem I have is that it will not set my TV to the correct video input. I?ve tried checking the programming and resynching with no success. So, I have to make this one setting manually, which is a minor annoyance considering the overall convenience of the device.
hooked it between my computer and my tv works great!
Works well for presentations where the longer cord is required.
this is the best over the air antena I ever had ,easy to install . I was able to enjoy all the channels in my area inmediately
Great buy. Has deep tones and sounds great. After years and years of not having a sub, now I can hear what was missing. It works great with everything from music to movies. Could only turn about half way up. It shakes the house! Just need to spend some time getting the settings set correctly and it will sound great.
It does what it is supposed to do. No bells or whistles but perfectly functional, especially for the price.
This piece of sh!t does not work for the note 5 wastebof money
Great
GOOD PRODUCTS
I bought a pair of these while on holiday in Las Vegas. After about three months the sound died in one earphone. When I contacted the company by email, they basically, said, ?tough?. After sending model no. etc, their response was : ?I?m sorry to inform you that, we wont be able to ship back the unit to UK.We only ship the replacement units to USA or Canada.? So bear it in mind if you buy these overseas and they stop working : you?re on your own. Sound quality wasn?t that great but acceptable as long as you weren?t anywhere busy. But basically, spend a little more and get better ones. With better aftersales service.
After rereading the negative reviews on this unit, I decided to send it back unopened, rather than take the 1in10 chance it was a DOA or infant mortality.
I?m giving this product a 4 star rating because of the excellent anker customer care support and warranty. However, it should be noted, that this product has some glaring quality issues, the 1st of 2 developed a distorted sound issue and the 2nd has an issue with the Bluetooth receiver, hence would not produce sound if connected with blue tooth. Both have been replaced and seem to be working fine for now
Excellent little Bluetooth speaker. Bought at Costco and am amazed at this bargain. No nonsense loud voices telling if you?re connected or not (finally!!) and the sound is outstanding considering the size of this item. I use it mainly in my car to listen to lectures and occasionally some music too. One thing that could be improved is the loudness although as is it fits the bill quite well. Where this thing impressed me the most though, is with its outstanding speakerphone capability. Not one complain yet from anyone I?ve spoken to through this little gizmo and that for me was a real deciding factor as tons of little BT speakers have as loud or louder a sound, long lasting battery, yadi yada...but their speakerphone in general mostly stink at best...this guy however pulls it off nearly as well as my way more expensive Sony SRS X3!! Cool design and colors BTW. Battery lasts quite many hours. Have not timed it but 67 hours minimum I?d say. Charges pretty fast too. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!!! Most reviewers are complaining about loosing the BT connection settings after turning it off. Some even mention the ridiculously long time it takes to shut it down lol. Once paired if you click the on/off button just once for a short second OR LESS the speaker will alternate between the on and off mode and go in standby mode. If you hold the button for a few seconds then a complete shutdown happens and therefore the connection settings may be lost. This in fact is a very welcome and refreshing function (like my Sony SRS X3) as holding the button down for a stupid amount of time is what?s required on most low to mid end BT speakers and I personally can?t stand it. It?s unnecessary and annoying. This one, one quick click it?s off, one quick click and it?s on... And remember, NO annoying voices either....I love that! Essentially a very well engineered piece of electronics. Btw it does mentioned being engineers in the USA and made in China. I?m not surprised by the results especially the speakerphone function (can?t stress its usefulness enough). Anyways, read the instructions and enjoy this remarkable and recommendable BT speaker. I?m probably gonna purchase a couple more for the price they sell. I absolutely and easily recommend this item.
Works ok.. Picks up good.. You can only turn up volume about half way.. Any more it becomes very distorted..
Great
Use this to connect my Raspberry Pi to a VGA monitor, and it works great! Also used this to connect my DirecTV HD receiver to my projector which does not support HDMI! Solid purchase!
Awesome speaker! Amazing rich sound. I?ve owned a dozen or so portable speakers similar to this and this one is at least 5 times better than any of the others!
Took some finagling, but they work very well.
It?s surprising how hard it is to find an alarm clock when you don?t use an iphone or ipad. This one isn?t too bad.  I like the night light availability. I wish the alarm noise was different, not sure if I?d hear it if I was sleeping. Also it?s a bit top heavy, not that it falls over by itself, but it can fall over if bumped.  But on a whole I like it!
The headline for this item says it?s stainless steel but but when you read the description is says it?s zinc. I can confirm it is zinc casting and not nearly as nice as what is shown in the images. False advertising. I returned for refund.
perfect for what I needed. Great seller
Great product
The connection is good! The aux cable and port don?t work for my second screen. You will probably have to find extra speakers to be able to use sound. Once you find the speakers, direct the sound through to them instead of the hdmi. This did come with an aux cable which I am happy about (:
Excellent corner mount. Met my expectations and showed up WAY before I expected it to. Very pleased with this purchase, would buy another.
this is my second set in a year that the speaker tears apart.. in the middle of a party speakers where less than a month old.. runing as B speakers from an ONKYO amp so not overpowered.
Love them.. won?t order anything else when it comes to writable dvds.....and the price is fantastic.
This charger is just want I wanted. A super fast charger for my multiKindle HD household. One older Kindle was having charging problems which were not helped using two of the chargers I already had, so I thought for sure that that the Kindle battery was at fault, and that would be the end of that. But no! The first of these RAPID power chargers that I bought charged what I believed was a dying Kindle very, very quickly!  Yahoo!! So within a week or so I purchased another charger as a spare. I also like the 6.5 foot cord, which makes it easier to just plug it in, while continuing to use your device. Highly recommend!
just what I needed
All my HDMI cables are Mediabridge. They work great. I have had Monster cables, which are way more expensive, and they have broken for no apparent reason but these hold up. I have had them for years.
Received as a gift, was surprised at how punchy and clean the bass is, and how good the sound quality is overall. I always have the bass bazuca on because I just like to have more bass in most everything I listen to. If you want a good music system with some punchy bass, that doesn?t cost you an arm and a leg, than try this out. Only con is that the buttons on actual receiver on the unit can take a few seconds, or just not work at all. Though the remote works very well.
99.9% worked and wife?s mac laptop would burn them so no complaints
adhesive poor
Just let them take your money already. It works flawaless with an iPhone, I have no doubts it also works with iPads. There are plenty of OBDII apps on the App Store (paid and free) that works with this device. You won?t regret it.
I love this little speaker I use it for the beach and the pool can?t beat it for the price my only wish is the range was a little bit further but oh well. Have to keep your phone within about 10 to 15 feet.
Amazing headphones! A year later and they still work great. They block out any outside noise and really puts you in the zone.
works very well, no issues
Great quality
The lamp works perfectly.  The reason I am giving 4 starts instead of 5 is because even though my TV is included among the compatible ones (WD65638) I was not able to make it fit using the included housing (was too big).  I tried for several minutes but the change must be a minimal size difference because at first glance both housings are pretty much identical.  I gave up in trying to make it fit with the included housing and finally I just resorted to taking the lamp out of it and put it inside the old housing that had the busted lamp. I would advise anyone that purchases this lamp to keep your old housing on hand instead of getting rid of it right away in case you are faced with the same problem that I had.
Works great
Stop working after 2year
The TaoTronics Model TTSK08 is a rugged looking, waterproof, outdoor Bluetooth speaker. It comes in an attractive box, which includes a manual in several languages, a USB charger cable, an audio cable, but no charger. You have to use the USB charger included with your phone, tablet or use the one on your computer. The speaker comes with a builtin rechargeable battery. It is not clear whether the battery can be replaced  perhaps by unscrewing the cover on the speaker. There is no indicator on the speaker of how much battery life is left. But an interesting feature is that next to the bluetooth icon on my iPhone/iPad there is a battery charge level indicator for the speaker. Advertised play time is pretty long but I did not verify. The speaker uses the newer Bluetooth 4 standard. Volume changes on device and speaker are in sync, which is a lot more convenient. However, the volume buttons do not have a second function to skip forward/backward like they have on Taotronics other models. You can pair more than one Bluetooth device with the speakers. However, the manual does not list how many devices can be paired with speaker. The bluetooth range is great and covers at least 30ft plus. Keep in mind that this is a Mono speaker. I would not call this speaker bidirectional since most of the sound is coming out the front. I believe the Bass is supposed to come out of the back Sound is a bit thin but quite acceptable for a speaker of this size and prize, and definitely loud enough across the room. The speaker has a microphone and can therefore be used as a speaker phone. The speaker plays the ring tone of your phone. A conversation on the phone was loud and clear and the microphone worked fine. The speaker can be put on a flat surface, has a large rubber handle and a tripod screw underneath. The rubberized covering looks strong and sturdy. I did not test how waterproof the speaker is. Overall a great outdoor speaker, great packaging, easy to read manual with clear contact information. A suggestion would be to include a travel pouch since you may want to throw this speaker in a beach bag or hiking backpack.
These worked great to connect older model sound system to new smart TV. Well built and durable.
worked great for almost 3 years and then the headphone port got loose so its useless now.  Still don?t regret buying it and I?m saddened its broken but they are made in china I should feel lucky it lasted that long.
Worked as they said.  Brought new life to my old Bose Sound dock.  I almost gave it away.  Now I can play and charge new generation iPod and iPhone.
work great sounds amazing
Product works great.
Very good
It works!  We recently bought a Samsung BluRay player as a gift for my soninlaw and his sweetie.  Their flat screen had soso builtin speakers and their old skool receiver had no HDMI inputs, just stereo RCA analog audio inputs.  I purchased this unit and ALSO purchased this cable [[ASIN:B0002J2B8I C2G / Cables To Go 29115 Velocity S/PDIF Digital Audio Coax Cable (6 Feet)]] .  When we hooked it up it immediately worked.  Audio content from movies sounds good, clear.  Sound is in sync with the picture.  Now their setup has some real bass and oomph.  This will be a solution for them until they can afford a modern 7.1 surround receiver/speaker setup.  Note:  We went into the BluRay player?s audio settings and confirmed that PCM was set as the default.                          CAVEATS, TECHNICAL ADVICE:  Caveat 1:  This only produces stereo output (Left and Right analog audio jacks).  In the setting of your BluRay player:  You ** have ** to use PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) output setting if you want this to work right   it specifies that right on the box.  Now, some people may have an older receiver that would have a feature to synthesize surround for a 5.1 system but usually, if you have that feature available to you, then one would &#34;tend to&#34; also have HDMI inputs on their receiver.  If you have HDMI inputs on your audio receiver... why bother?  This is a work around for those who don?t.  IF your receiver has HDMI inputs, the high likelihood is that you don?t need this.  IF your receiver has HDMI inputs and you aren?t getting audio output 1. Check your settings and the sequence in which you turn components on  (I find that turning on my plasma TV before turning on my receiver works better).  2.  You might need to find an HDMI cable that specifies it has &#34;audio return&#34;.  All that being said, if you need this kind of workaround solution to deliver an analog feed an older sound system, then  &#62; running your BluRay player?s sound output through a decent stereo?s analog inputs using this interface conversion box beats the pants off using the the wimpy speakers in most TVs.                                                               Caveat 2:  OREI DOES ** NOT ** GIVE YOU A NONOPTICAL (i.e. copper wire) CABLE ...which I believe will be the solution most people actually want.  YOU HAVE TO PURCHASE ONE SEPARATELY.  I strongly recommend buying a specifically &#34;Digital&#34; cable, labeled as being meant for SPDIF (Sony/Panasonic Digital Interface) like in the link I mentioned above  they run 5  10 dollars.  If you try using a conventional RCA analog audio cable the digital signal may corrupt or the sound could stutter, especially over longer cable lengths.                                       Caveat 3:  I suppose there may be some BluRay players out there that, for cost cutting purposes, have omitted the SPDIF connector that looks like a single RCA jack.  In which case this product would not be a solution you could use.  Final note:  This unit also comes with an optical connector interface and a probably 3 ft optical cable.  I did not use that feature or test it so cannot speak to how well it works.  You * could * run the bluray player?s HDMI cable to your flat screen and then, IF it had an optical out, use the supplied optical cable to this OREI box and then run RCA analog cables to your stereo.  The big unknown is:  Will the audio output &#34;lag&#34; or stay in sync with your TV?  Sometimes you can set video / sound delay in your TV.  You?d just have to test.  Again, if your receiver has HDMI built in, there is usually no need to use this kind of product.
These are probably a little over kill for my needs, but they work and were fairly inexpensive, so I can?t complain. I use them to connect my DAC to an amplifier, and they work well for that.
Well constructed, durable and attractive case with the right number of slots.
GOOD PRODUCTS
I had previous universal remotes that would work perfectly for multiple device/multiple services, and work as advertise. This one in spite of extra blasters does not work as reliably. I had problems making it work with my LG TV and now with ROKU. It worked just fine with ROKU in my home theater for a few days and then stops.
As stated by other customers, this product does not work with XBOX ONE. Always check the customer questions and answers before purchase.
Works great!
Very nice outlet that not only give you more outlets in one, but also has the function of using it to charge my cell phone and other items that use the USB port function, nice to have the dual functionality.
Cool
They work fine.
Awsome
This product is obviously dependent on your monitor and device, I used this with my surface pro 3 SP3 and most VGA monitors won?t budge, constantly detecting but no picture flickering screen, so tried with an HDMI and DVI connection on similar monitor and that worked. So for the money and the fact it does work I give it four stars since I can?t confirm is VGA truly works
wearable under a helmet.  pure magic....
great
Excellent product.  Great value for the money.  My mother will be thrilled.
Used these for 13 hours on a flight to Europe.  A baby cried the entire trip, except when he was asleep for 2 hours.  They didn?t drown out all the sound, but they sure kept me sane.  They are very comfortable, too.
Very good.
Works great!
My only gripe is that my computer wont work through this.  Plug the hdmi in to my computer and into this to feed to the tv and nothing happens, otherwise it works great.
Love this... sturdy, easy to use.  Great sound.  Controls a little different from my older one, but I figured them out... Specifically sound and turning off.  Volume while in a song hit the up and down arrow keys... which is different from my older one that actually had a volume button on the side.  and to turn off, a song must be paused, or it does not turn off.
very nice product, I really like !!
I cut the cord a while ago with cable but the NFL is back and I wanted CBS, ABC, NBC and FOX.  I get all of them in perfect clarity with 30 some odd other random channels that can be entertaining.  I think this is perfect if that?s all you?re looking for. Oh and my house if from 1928, and the walls are rock solid.  I have this on the first floor about 5 feet from the nearest window just standing there next to my PS4 and it?s clear as day.  I didn?t have to try and turn it east/west or shoot lightning at it with a Tesla Coil to get a proper signal. I just plugged it in, ran the channel scan, and a few minutes later it worked. I used this before i purchased http://transition.fcc.gov/mb/engineering/dtvmaps/ It?s a 25 mile HD antenna and i?m 15 miles from the signal so make sure you check that first. Good luck!
It stopped working the first day it got here. It?s too fragile and it?s already falling apart. I could of just brought the wire that comes with a hdmi mini instead of this horrible adapter.
This is a fantastic product.  I can?t live without these upstairs and down... this is made well, sturdy, and has held up well over the course of several months.  We ordered several so that we have the convenience of charging things upstairs or down  and bought a bulk pack of tether cords so we always have them plugged in and waiting ... I can?t tell how it would be if you pulled plugs in & out of it all the time, because we opted to buy the tethers and keep them plugged in, but it seems otherwise made really well  so my guess is it would hold up well for  the long haul. love it!
I bought this cord to attach my laptop to my TV and it works great for that. I bought this cord three years ago and my only complaint is that occasionally there will be no sound with the video, which is generally fixed by unplugging the cord and plugging it in again. But for a $2 cord, at the time I bought it, I can deal with that. I still use this cord occasionally when I cannot use chromecast and I have had no problems with any wear and tear. Definitely recommend buying this cord over any cord you could get at Best Buy or another brick and mortar electronic store, because its basically overpriced for what it is.
made like crap, but cost 3 bucks shipped prime so it was worth it.  The button barely works half the time but the mic is ok.  Will buy again as a throw away option
Works great!
Ok,from what I?ve seen, this converter keeps all the data transfered  from audio/video(RCA)  to HDMI. It only helps with the extra power supplied(most adaptors are simply cables/wires). This is exactly what I needed, since I?ve used both rca to HDMI and  HDMI to rca, I can say this is a fantastic product. The only thing I would like to see is a power brick(cell phone USB to outlet) includedfree of course,because they?re at the dollar store and are needed to plug the usb power cord into. Minor,I had spares.
Feels a little fragile, but works fine.
I love these earphones! They?re very good for the price which is cheap.
I can?t say enough about this splitter. With someone in the bedroom next to ours, my wife and I often watch movies or TV shows later at night using headphones. What makes these exceptional is the separate volume control on each side. My hearing isn?t as good as hers, so it used to be difficult settling on a volume that worked well for both of us. That?s no longer an issue since we bought these. They?ve worked perfectly so far. As such, it?s easy to recommend them.
Great sound!  I use these in golf carts, paired with phones for music.  They work great, and so far have held a charge longer than I have used them.
good product
LOVE THEM! GREAT SOUND IN A LITTLE PACKAGE. PERFECT FOR MY DECK.
I used this mount to install an older, and heavier, Toshiba 37&#34; LCD TV in my home tiki bar.  The mount was inexpensive, easy to install and it?s well made especially at this price point.  I liked the fact that it would adjust upwards from a 20&#34; ceiling to mount measurement.  I needed the 20&#34; mount measurement.  Yes, the allen screw that holds the swivel mount would eventually keep loosening if the television is swiveled frequently but there?s a long enough bolt that it won?t happen overnight.  We won?t be swiveling the tv much so I have no concerns.  Overall it?s a great value.
Works Great
missing any way to charge it
Good quality
I received this cable on August 25, 2015.  I had purchased it for use in a hifi system along with a Wharfedale 8&#34; subwoofer.  I had read good things, but I was still surprised by the quality of this cable when it arrived.  I also use BlueRigger HDMI cables, and I am very happy with those, so I bought this as well.  It is a very thick, dual shielded cable, and the ends are gold plated and fit snugly with no play.  It was exactly what I needed.  Bass was crisp and clear, no hum or interference.  I ended up replacing this with a MediaBridge cable because I discovered that if I used a cable with a split mono lead, I could get a bit more input level and a noticeable gain in output.  I wish that BlueRigger made a split mono version.  I briefly considered buying a small splitter adapter and a second one of these because of how nice it is, but the cost would have been too high.  If your subwoofer uses a crossover that only requires a single RCA connection, then this is the cable to get.  If you can get a bit more level using a splitter, or a split mono cable, then go that route because there is a noticeable difference. Pros: Thick, high quality cable Gold plated ends Snug fitting No hum or interference (dual shielded) Cons: Not offered in a split mono version All in all, I will be using more BlueRigger products in the future and I look forward to seeing their line expand. I rate this cable at 5/5 stars and highly recommend BlueRigger products.  For the cost vs. quality this is easily one of the best brands on Amazon.
It works, but the sound quality is getting worse than the sound quality directly from the PC. This makes the device not very useful.
3 of the 4 I ordered stopped working and wont charge after the first use. They were used in a flash light and lasted one night.
This worked great until the battery/power failed on it, like every other portable Bluetooth speaker I?ve owned.
I love it
Great product at a great price. I use it at the beach, backyard, garage, car. Have never run out of battery before I was finished using it. Range is variable depending on conditions and if you?re moving around, but practically around 20 ft...which is all I need.
I?ve burned five so far and they all fail to read correctly in either of my players. Tried a different brand and all was fine.  Waste of money for me.
I actually like these more than the bose quietcomfort line.  Way better audio
PROS Crisp sound Super comfortable and secure fit Great price  CONS *edit* actually the bass issue was an issue with my computer rather than the ear phones, my bad
It did just what we thought it would do we like it very well. Thanks
This is a nice little player for someone who likes to listen to tunes on the go. It?s not as fancy as some of its more expensive counterparts, but for the price it gets the job done nicely. The color is really pretty and has a nice shimmer to it. I really like it, gotta love anythings that?s pretty to look at. As far as the performance, since it comes with a 16 GB Micro SD card, it holds a TON of songs. You can replace the SD card in this player, however you can not expand it. 16 GB is the maximum that it can handle, so that is something to keep in mind. I love filling mine up if I am taking a day trip and don?t want to risk losing my more expensive players. This is perfect for that. It is plug and play for the most part, though if you are trying to follow the included instructions I found them to be a bit confusing. Luckily, I am familiar with this type of device, so I was able to figure out how to operate it fairly easily. I received one to review and overall, I am happy with it. Aside from a few small things that could be improved, this is just what I was looking for.
These headphones are excellent...the noise cancelling feature wipes out all low frequency sound and clarifies the music...the only complaint is the placement of the switch for the noise cancelling device, it?s too far down on the wire and awkwardly placed forcing me to clip it to my belt which again is awkward...but that aside they are incredible especially for the price...
Great product for short dollars.
I so regret buying this. Its a large cell phone and has no functions as computer. Screen cracked in 5 places within months without being dropped or mishandled. Any other company would have tobfix screen for free but not apple!
Good quality music and very portable
Piece of crap cables. Distorted sound after a month. Snow on the screen. Used to be great quality, not anymore. Every single one does the same thing.
These are great oldschool speakers but...$1700 a pair. Really? I bought a new pair (unfinished) for $730 in the late 80s. For that kind of money I?d throw in a few more bucks and get some MartinLogan electrostatics. UPDATE: $2000? Shocking. I would not buy these speakers at that price.
This unit replaces a decadesold Radio Shack model that died. This one doesn?t suddenly blast out an exceedingly high volume warning tone like the old one did (which always scared the living daylights out of us) . It starts with low volume and then escalates to high level so it can be heard throughout the house. The speaker is a huge improvement over the old one, as is the display; the screen is well lit, angled up from the unit, and easy to read. I?ll be purchasing another as a Christmas gift for a relative.
I like it so much!  Very clear loud sound. I ordered three items of that product.
Arrived in time.  A little larger that I expected.  That?s not a problem.  Thanks!!
A little delicatecan bend with too much force. If used delicatelyworks fine.
The red color is a little hard to read in the dark but I love that it has the temperature on the clock.  Now when I complain that it is warm, I can prove it!
These things are awesome. They fit snug. The cord looks durable and is quite long. Would buy again if I have the need.
Perfect for the job
I purchased this as a gift for my boyfriend and I must say this is a great speaker, the sound quality is good and the light feature is neat. We really enjoyed watching the lights on the color display however after further research my boyfriend decided the JBL Charge 2 plus was more practical for him. He will be using the speaker at work in an outside environment and it is better for outdoor use, there are 2 subs on the end so it provides a better base sound. The charge 2 can charge your phone and allow up to 3 bluetooth devices to be connected vs. the JBL Pulse which will only allow one. Overall if you are looking for a cool light display the JBL Pulse might be for you, but if you are looking for more practicality and versatility I would recommend the JBL Charge 2.
Excelent item, it fits great.
This speaker is amazing and straightforward, especially for the price. It is easy to use and includes some cool features. so I was a little skeptical of the quality. It can be paired with most devices with Bluetooth and is also compatible with most devices that have a 3.5mm port. The package included one usb cable, one 3.5mm audio cable, bike holder, and user manual. I am not sure how far the range will work, I have used it up to about 1520 feet away without any problems. The speaker performs really well and would work great. Good bass! I?m really pleased with the bluetooth speaker. You can take along with it anywhere you go.
Works great
I give it four stars and three thumbs up
Love this thing so much. The battery lasts pretty long and though there could be more bass in the speakers, it gets the job done pretty well! It?s loud, and it sounds good. 10/10 would buy again.
Dispite the cost, these pay for themselves easily.  I have two sets and their competitors, and these last the longest.
Very Good!!
Good quality item with lots of outlets and long cord.
This was an inexpensive replacement for my damaged chord, and has worked great!  I did had a quality issue with the first one sent by It is, only hearing out of one ear, and the way the company handled it was excellent! They immediately sent a good replacement, and I ended up ordering more products from them as a result, all have performed well and the orders were prompt.
Lost my original remote. This worked right away on my television.
One of the best purchases I?ve made. I?ve always had issues with ear tips. I find the medium ones are not filling enough to the ear, but the large tips overfilled that they came out or would feel weird. These buds are perfect, I mush them before putting them inside the ears and they expand and fill space until its super snug. They improved the sound of my ear phones significantly. Sound is more full and bass is richer. Wish I had got these sooner.
This device has worked better than expected.  No more running around the house trying to find cable to charge are devices.  Now I can charge my two devices, my daughters Nabi Jr. and sons phones in one spot. On a recent car trip, we used a 90 watt A/C adapter in the car and kept the kids stuff charged for the 2 10 hour leg journeys without creating any heat on the converter. Considering getting another one just for my work and use it in place of my tapping into my works PC USB ports.
Easy to use and assemble. Great value.
I originally wanted a music player that was cheap and had a vast expandable memory slot for just listening to music onthego. Though, it seemed like I would have to sacrifice one or the other, I was going to get an unlocked smart phone until I came across this guy. It?s not perfect, however, I rate it 5 stars for what you get for $100. Don?t be fooled either, It is an amazing player that I believe is more favorable over an iPod Classic and other expensive HiRes Players. At first glance, It looks like a knockoff of a smaller version of an iPod Classic which greets you with an expeditious bootup and on to the main screen that will throw you off a bit. It?s easy to navigate using the mechanical jog wheel which feels sturdy and has minimal leeway. The settings are simple to understand and has tech manual included if you decide you need to use it after you?ve thrown it out. The chassis feels solid even with the plastic back panel and comes with a silicone case too if you?re feeling skeptical. The battery is long lasting (approximately 11 hours) and has a micro USB jack to charge it. There are two types of ways to view your music: File Mode and Category Mode. In File Mode, It will appear exactly how you arrange your files or music on your removable drive window on your computer which allows users to customize and organize their music listings, for example, I sorted my music by Artist &#62; Album &#62; Songs. This will require some time and can be fixed by updating your files in settings which will automatically designate your music based on the files? detailed information under Category Mode. The only drawback to Category Mode, which I believe is the only major drawback, is that you can only store 5800 songs in Category Mode yet you can have as many songs as your MicroSD card can fit under File Mode. Some of the user interface abilities could have been improved but unfortunately, Fiio has stopped making updates for the X1 and will soon be replaced by the X3 Next Generation. All in all, this player has exceeded my expectation and I will try out some loseless music to see the true potential of the X1.
I bought this for my 16 year old?s birthday. Awesome easy to use. The Bluetooth works great. Sound is good. Solid purchase.
I love it, I connect it up with my computer when I am home and use it to stream my music from my phone to my car when I am driving.
Double your extension strip?s input Very useful, don?t overload the wattage though Absolutely a must for those computer assessarries? adapters
Loved this product, got it as a gift and really worth every bit. The material is solid and most importantly the sounds are crisp and clear compared to my laptop speakers. Being boombox speakers, I can blast the sound to share music with friends, play movies, or even just jam out and I don?t lose quality of the sound. As great as the product was, the customer service was so accommodating and helpful, really shows the company cares for their customers.
I own a pair of inear Bose phones which I use, one ear only when driving. I wanted something for the office and trips where I don?t have to drive that would keep out the noise but not compromise the sound quality. I was not disappointed with these. Would recommend them to everyone and definitely worth the money.
Simple product that works as expected.  I particularly like the fact that this extension is coiled so that I only use the desired length.
How cute is this! This cute little bluetooth speaker has some BASS! I set this on a table and the box was next to it, and the box was bumping up and down with the bass.  I couldn?t believe it. lol I wouldn?t have thought that it would have that much power. I am in love with this .  I can put it on the counter while i am cleaning and hook it to my galaxy note edge , and dance while i get the work done. The kids were dancing and loved it too. This is easy to sync to your phone, and charges easily to your usb for your computer. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. However I don?t just give glowing reviews to a product just because i received it free or a discount. If my review helped you in any way please click the &#34; LIKE &#34; button!
I recieved two of these antennas. The first one does a fair job of channel reception. I have a couple of another brand and these are equivalent to those at a reduced price. Now for the criticism. Of the two that I recieved, only one was usable. One installed easily on my television, on the second one they neglected to thread the connect and therefore it will not install on a tv so it is worthless to me or anyone else. Given the low price, I expect that I will throw it away rather than both with attempting to return half of an order.
Pretty and clean, however I feel like you have to twist the end into my laptop quite a bit for it to make a sound  if its not at a perfect angle sound will only come out of one ear. Its a very nice product and great earphones for what they are but I wish that sound would emerge effortlessly without me having to constantly adjust the angle
This item did not work at all. I spent a good deal of time researching personal cassette players on this site. I settled on this one for the &#34;bass boost.&#34; The packing looked original with one minor cut opening on a top corner. I installed brand new batteries only to find it did nothing. I tried different sets of new batteries just to make sure. Nothing worked. I?m highly disappointed. It was a plus that the item arrived earlier than the expected date. Too bad it doesn?t work. I have requested a refund and return shipping. If they ship a working tape player, I will definitely share that too.
Nice sound. It cuts out from time to time and will occasionally stop playing for some reason. I will have to push play again
After syncing them when my phone the music would drop in and out of connection. This occured when the speakers, and phone were less than 4 feet away. I am returning these. I connected them to both my phone and laptop to trouble shoot, both same results.
I bought these from BestBuy a few weeks back, and I am incredibly disappointed with their shockingly poor quality. After using them regularly, I suddenly noticed that the leftchannel was slightly softer than the rightchannel. This situation continued until the audio in the rightchannel unexpectedly decided one day to disappear entirely. I suspect that the wiring inside the earbud has broken, and this should tell you everything you need to know about its poor construction. Now, the leftchannel is barely functioning and sounds muffled one minute and then fine the next. Again, I suspect the poor construction is the culprit. I could technically RMA them to Sony as it is within 30 days, but I don?t see the point on wasting money on shipping that could go towards a better pair from a different manufacturer. Bottom line: Don?t buy, or you?ll regret it.
Strapped it on my paddle board and took it for a ride, so far so good. Definitely waterproof.
They are not the most comfortable things, and they only work really well while near fully charged. But they get the job done and for the price you won?t find any better.
Works as expected. Warranty is good. Build quality seems decent.
These are for special batteries, specifically for vaping. These fit my batteries perfectly. I use larger sized batteries. I have too many batteries already. The cases APPEAR to have knotches if you don?t use the full sized batteries that MIGHT prevent them from sliding, but I am only 50% sure, I am using the 18650 sized batteries.
As advertised
Louder than I expected and the sound quality is good. I like the design and it?s easy to carry with me around the house. I?d consider another model if I were looking for a speaker again, because this one makes loud beeping sounds when you turn it on and a LOUD voice says &#34;pairing&#34; and then &#34;connecting&#34; every time it links to your Bluetooth. It is extremely annoying.
This unit was just the perfect size pow and price I wante I got the first on the volume knob kind of stuc so that made me suspicious I plugged it in worked a little bit then got distortion feedback a couple of times,it overheated ,I let cool,  it worked again, then overheated again so I sent it back and thought I?d get another one, that one came and has been working great so far,  sounds good, bluetooth works Ive got a DVD player plugged into and it works great
does the job!
Great cable. Fits my HD598s perfectly and the red cable with black sleeving matches the brown on the headset much better than the black cable that came with the headphones. The included 1/4&#34; screwon adapter is very high quality and the springstyle is a unique touch that matches the connectors very well. Definitely a great upgrade if you want something that looks or feels different from the stock cable or need a replacement cable.
Excellent. Love it.
Excellent product
Beautiful screen, fast shipping! Very pleased!
The amplifier made almost no difference in the reception.  I live 1015 miles from the tower and most channels came in fine before using the amplifier.  I added the amplifier in hopes of improving the reception on the weak channels but it made almost no difference in how the weak channels performed.
Best blue tooth speaker for the money
Great!
I bought this product after reading many reviews that didn?t have much detail or specifics, such as TV size, type, equipment model numbers, viewing distance, default TV settings or optimized, room lighting, 2D/3D, which are all factors that impact viewing clarity. I purchased the product to experiment and provide that detail in one review. Overall this product DID bring out additional detail when viewed up close, it was just not noticeable from the location where we watch the TV in 2D or 3D. This is why I have given it an &#34;OK&#34; rating. We sit approximately 11 feet away from the TV in a completely dark room directly in front of the TV (No angle). I didn?t really notice any difference until I was 2 feet away from the front of the TV.  The unit has a test mode where one half of the picture has been clarified and the other half has not, for your comparison. We primarily watch movies in Bluray or upconverted DVD?s and all my equipment is Samsung. (TV has been setup to provide optimum color and clarity. (Not setup with factory default settings). TV Model Number: PN64D550C1F. Bluray player Model number is HTD550). I also tried it on our cable input to see if that made much of a difference. It did not. Again, from our viewing position, we sit too far away for it to provide any noticeable improvement in clarity. To sum up, it works as defined but really did not provide us with a better viewing experience for the size and type of TV based on the viewing distance we watch from. This unit is somewhat expensive and I would not recommend its purchase for TV?s of my size and type or smaller.  I think it is really designed for very large screen projector style TV?s.
[[ASIN:B003EM800S Panasonic RPHJE120S InEar Headphone, Silver]] I have been using these Panasonics for over a year now.  For me, they are still the biggest bang for the buck.  I thought I lost my last pair so I decided to &#34;splurge&#34; and pay twice the price for these SoundMAGICs as I heard great things.  There are reviews that specifically compares my Panasonics to the ES18s where great majority states that ES18s are the clear winner. For me, however, it isn?t all that clear.  Perhaps from sound quality alone that may be the case but the nominal gains you get in sound quality can be negated by some of the other factors that I considered. I found my set of Panasonics after I received the ES18 which allowed me to conduct a side by side comparison. Some notes about the comparison:  I am not an audiophile but I do appreciate a good set of headphones.  Let?s just say that I?m willing to pay up to $20 for a good set.  Used the ES18 for a few days before comparing to allow burn in period (~60 hrs).  Same music and videos were used on iPad Mini and iPhone 5.  I switched the two earphones back and forth between the two devices to make sure that there wasn?t a sound difference from device source.  There wasn?t.  I had one set in one ear and the other set in other ear at the same time (but this actually made it harder to tell the difference between the two). What I found in order of personal importance: Sound quality winner: SoundMAGIC ES18 Both delivers good bass for such affordable sets.  Online sources say the ES18?s bass is superior.  I couldn?t tell and must call that a draw.  The lowest lows from both sets seemed near equal.  Both had that headbobbing thump that makes listening to them enjoyable.  Where the ES18 wins is the mid?s.  My slight criticism of the Panasonics is that the mid?s do seem a bit flat making the ES18 seem more balanced.  I can also hear more detail in the ES18.  And because the more balanced approach, voice clarity is better on the ES18 also.  At first I thought that the Panasonics had better bass but it?s because it seems to &#34;push&#34; the lows (making the lower range louder) but in reality the absolute lows of both sets were fairly, and near equally, deep.  Some may prefer the Panasonic?s overemphasis on the low end.  So the ES18 has better sound because of the balance, more mid, overall detail and voice clarity.  How much more did I enjoy the ES18 in terms of sound quality?  In a completely subjective term: a little.  Yes, there is a clear difference on HOW they sound but it took me a couple hours of going back and forth to ultimately say I ENJOY the sound of ES18 more. Comfort and design winner:  Panasonic RPHJE120 This one was absolutely clear to me as soon as I put on the ES18.  The Panasonic?s &#34;Ergofit&#34; design has the offset ear insert and a flat surface to lay in the flat spot next to the ear hole.  Not only does the Ergofit design make it more comfy, it allows a more secure fit.  The ear insert itself on the Panasonics is smaller probably due to the smaller driver size (9mm vs. 10mm).  While neither are heavy, you can tell the weight of the ES18 is higher (again, probably due to the larger driver size).  Also, the Panasonic?s shape doesn?t protrude out of the ear as much as the ES18.  You could almost side sleep with the Panasonics on. Other design consideration is the discerning between the left and and the right insert.  The Panasonic?s design is distinct to which ear insert belongs to which side of the ear (due to the flat surface as part of the Ergofit design).  You?ll be able to understand and see from a distance which insert belongs to which ear within seconds of ownership.  The ES18, on the other hand, is symmetric in design.  There is a tiny little &#34;R&#34; at the cord stem for the right side but it?s impossible to see in low lighting.  I now go by the &#34;ES18&#34; written on the right insert.  The left side does not have a &#34;L&#34; but I know now that the left insert has SoundMAGIC?s insignia on that side.  The point is, you can tell the left and right on the Panny?s easily but you?ll have see up close to discern on the ES18. Cord material winner:  SoundMAGIC ES18 Another no brainer.  The Panny?s thin cord allows it to get tangled easily.  I like the heft that the ES18?s cord has that resist tangling.  I?m spending anywhere between 10 seconds to a minute untangling or unknotting the Panny?s cord everytime I take it out of my gym bag.  Haven?t done once with ES18.  While this may not seem like a big deal, I?ve had more &#34;Not again!&#34; moments when I took the Panasonics out of my bag than I?d care for. Cost winner:  Panasonic RPHJE120 At around six bucks, less than half price of the ES18. To say which I like more is tough to answer when you factor in cost and comfort.  I give both 5 stars.  Yes I do think the ES18 sounds better but I still quite enjoy the Panasonic?s sound.  What you get for the money on either is extraordinary.  Those that appreciate a balanced approach and have a more critical ear should look into the ES18.  Those that just want something better than the cruddy stock earbuds that came with your mobile device can?t go wrong with the $6 Panasonics. UPDATE 10/1/15: There is an L indicating the left ear piece.  I missed that initially.  Just proves how hard it is to see the L and R indicators.  I placed a little strip of red tape on the right ear piece so I can easily tell the difference. I find myself reaching for the ES18 over the Panasonics when sidebyside as I do enjoy the sound of these more when I want to rock out. The bass has a better impact as you can hear both the subbass and midbass while the Panny?s bass seem blended together.  The sound stage is another significant difference where the ES18 sound much more open.  The Panny?s sound like listening to loud speakers in a small enclosed room compared to these.  There?s so much debate in the online universe about which value IEMs have the best sound stage presentation (i.e. Brainwavz Delta and now Jive, Xiaomi Pistons, Phillips SHE3590, SoundSoul products, MEE products) but I think these ES18?s do a very good job and, generally in the online community, are well regarded.  Man, I?m still dizzy from trying to decipher online what is the best value IEM.  There?s so many out there in the $5$25 range that?s rated well.  I guess that?s a win for us value consumers.  The biggest concensus knock against the ES18 I found online is that the treble is rolled off and lacks the sizzle that some prefer.  I?m ok with it as I don?t want anything piercing. My biggest personal gripe is that the bass is nonexistent at moderate to low volume so I do prefer the Panny?s when I?m in a mellow mood.  The Panny?s still have a good thump at lower volumes.  The ES18?s bass presence is hugely dependent on volume and without that presence, it completely lacks depth.  I didn?t see many complaints about this online so I?m wondering if it?s an issue with my set or am I the only one who cares?  I?m going to assume the latter as the set works just fine otherwise.  And because of the bassvolume dependency, the ES18?s lose versatility.  I?m one of those that listen to all kinds of music so the lack of versatility is somewhat disappointing.  I?m glad to have both in the end.  I?ll probably use these 4 of 5 times and use the Panny?s for the remainder for sit down listening.  It?s Panny?s all the way for working out due to the more comfortable and secure fit. Added note:  I?m now a proud owner of the Panasonic TCM125?s (down to $9 here on Amazon!), the RPHJE120 equivalent with mic and remote.  Gave the 120?s to the GF who lost her stock buds.  Now I can answer calls during workout without having to pull phone out of pocket.  Some say the 125?s soundbetter and some say the 120?s sound better (CNET says latter).  I went back and forth after burning in the 125?s.  I cannot tell a difference.  To me it?s the same darn thing; it?s just a matter of paying extra $3 to get the mic/remote. One thing I will say is that both Panny?s can get much louder than the ES18.  It may be a matter of impedence and/or sensitivity.  I think the highest volume for the ES18 will be more than enough for the average listener but not for those that want it super loud.s have the best sound stage presentation (i.e. Brainwavz Delta and now Jive, Xiaomi Pistons, Phillips SHE3590, SoundSoul products, MEE products) but I think these ES18?s do a very good job and, generally in the online community, are well regarded.

It?s a solid cable, well designed.  My only caveat, though it?s a big one, is that it?s remote functionality is nonexistent on my device.. The volume control & answer call button are guaranteed to work with ALL Samsung designed Android devices, but I have a Droid Turbo.  From reading other reviews, it?s a cropshoot as to the level of functionality it may have with your android device.  I?ve had my Momentums for 2 years now, & this cable makes them sound great again, better than new in fact as it is true highend headphones sound better with age!!  Also, notice the end of the cable you plug in, the &#34;lowprofile angled plug&#34;; it has been redesigned as to decrease it?s chance of breaking off or getting in the way of things.  Wanted to give 5 stars, but cannot for the reason aforementioned.  I hope Sennheiser releases a more universally compatible remote cable such as this in future, though the blame may be more on the device manufacturer side... Motorola!
It works as advertised.
I love Eneloop batteries. I?ve had some for years, and they continue to take a great charge.
Great little speaker that sounds great in the shower. I love using it in the mornings to listen to my language books on audio!
love it
Simple stereo cable joiner. Works great for hooking up a Bluetooth receiver to my car stereo system.
Thanks a lot it is amazing But amazon cut from my visa 2 times and still not back my money
Works great!
quick service good quality
My son really likes these in ear headphones .
Working great.
Perfect fit for my 19&#34; kitchen tv that now can swivel around for viewing from anywhere. Heavily built to last, tilts in all directions, can be tightened in one spot or left slightly snug to allow free movement. I even used a couple of the extra braces (used for larger tvs) to attach external speakers to the sides of my tv and it looks and performs great. Good price for a well built tv mount
great sound!
Doesn?t work all the time. Not sure if it?s the the Kinivo, the devices connected to it, or the cables. My Fios cable box stopped working with this after a year.
I own this and bought one for my child?s teacher as a gift. I compared this side by side with a Jambox and this was superior, and cheaper. Highly recommended. Much more realistic and full sound than any other portable speaker I have heard. Originally $100, now $6070. The newer Flip 2 can be charged via usb; this only has a power adapter to charge it, but it?s cheaper and sufficient for me.
Great headphones! I love them, they work and sound great when I work out.
It?s an electrical cord... does what it?s supposed to.
Great audio quality, length and style upgrade over my neon green 10fter for my Q701s.  You won?t be disappointed.
It?s exactly what you?d expect
its really good
Twisted Veins cables very good quality these are the only cables I buy now
Great mount.  Love that the power cord holds it in place.
Great cleaning tool for electronics screens. It doesn?t leave lint. Its shape also means that it gets into the hard to reach corners and edges very well even when the surface to be cleaned in recessed below surrounding parts. Has no problems getting a screen clean on all areas of the screen surface.
I have many other bluetooth headsets and this one has the expected range of about 1525 feet maximum with clear line of sight to your phone or computer. However the audio will cut out here and there very so often.For under $15 the pair is ok for music. I do not recommend it for more than that price and I do not recommend it for video playback as the cheaper chipset inside loses slight connection even in clear line of sight to the bluetooth source and your video goes out of audio sync and that ruins it as a video playback bluetooth headset. Its mostly made of cheaply put together plastic so durability is not the greatest but its good enough if you take care and caution when putting then back in your backpack or purse etc. The fit is good and they say put for the most part, even though the wing tips that come with them are pretty much useless as they do not give a tight secure fit like many of the other more expensive bluetooth headsets do. I do not think they will be very sweat resistant so if you are a heavy sweater you may want to look elsewhere. However I cannot say for sure bc I do not not sweat a lot and even though its a cheap plastic build they do have the slightest of separation from your ear in that its hard to get actual drops of sweat on them unless you have longer hair and its wet or again are a real heavy sweater or runner etc. There are many generic branded versions of this headset (Mpow, iclever etc) and some are a little better with a better chipset and have aptx certification (supposedly, and its supposedly supposed to be better more CD like quality sound) so the filesonic version of this headset is the cheaper version but it sounds good enough for everyday or gym use. Im no audiophile and sound is subjective, but its good enough for me and on par with many other sets I have. I can only tell a slight decrease in quality vs the aptx certified version I also have but its so slight that Im sure only audiophiles can tell the difference. Overall I would recommended them for about $15 bucks or cheaper and pretty much for music only use and possibly the gym if you are not a runner or heavy sweater.br />Overall I would recommended them for about $15 bucks or cheaper and pretty much for music only use and possibly the gym if you are not a runner or heavy sweater.
I?m upgrading from a Yamaha Aventage 2000 receiver which still works great.  I decided to upgrade because I wanted a receiver that does Dolby Atmos and DTS:X and also has HDMI 2.0a: and HDCP 2.2 support.  There have been many improvements over the last five years which have been incorporated into the receiver.  (Too many to mention.)  It plays louder, has a smoother, more balanced sound, and seems to run cooler than my old unit.  It took about thirty minutes to get everything set up including a basic calibration.  ( I?m coming from a previous Yamaha receiver so I knew what to expect, but the quick setup guide makes it pretty simple to get started for people not used to the Yamaha brand.)  Forgot to add :  The standard antennaeconnected radio works great.  (Something my previous Yamaha 2000 did poorly.)  The Internet radio is also performing superbly.
Pretty cool that you can charge the battery without the battery being inserted/connected to the headphones!
This cable functioned properly for just over a month, past the Amazon return period, and then shorted out. Other cables worked fine when substituted into the same system and connected to the same components (MacBook Pro and ACER monitor).
Great but ports are staticy on screen might just be my TV but not a big deal it was to hook up a chromecast and mostly sound equipment sound works fine and pip is cool!
Great for the money
Brilliant invention. It stays put playing even while I?m jogging. Never skips. Lovely clear sound!
I?ve had these earphones for several years... the sound is wonderful... however the control that it has was made to do ONLY works with iphones.  With all other phones (android) you can only listen to the phone.  No volume control and no microphone usage, no start/pause the music... you just hear sound.
arrived when and as should have
Noise cancellation is great as well
Works amazingly. Wish it had 1 more row but that?s not a real complaint.
Works perfect, good price.
Works as advertised
Good wire, low cost. Would buy again or recommend to others.
Love the purple color, voice is very clear and soothing. Great to carry in purse or pocket. I use it alot at night when I cannot sleep and am to tired to read and my eyes will not focus. I like that it is the NIV version, I have another that was KJV that stopped working. Very happy with purchase.
Purchased for Xbox One headset. Works as expected.
The batteries slide in super easily and everything seems great!
Very Good. Received promptly.
Works just fine
The sound is good, but too many plastic, and the plug is very cheap.
Not extremely loud, but tremendous battery life and battery display through Bluetooth on iPhone is a great feature.  Good shipping and customer service at the time of sale.
Poor quality bulb didn?t last even a year
Used this little gem for our backyard &#34;drivein&#34; movie and worked perfectly with great clarity and loudness.  I was worried it wouldn?t be loud enough, but wow! it really kicked it out.
Very good quality cable
Works  fine.
these things are soooo great. i have fairly large ears and my ears fit perfectly in them. By far the most comfortable cushions i?ve ever tried and very easy installation.
Much easier to hook up TV on the patio. Picked up several digital channels that wouldn?t come in on rooftop older TV antenna.
It stopped working within 5 minutes in the shower and never worked again. Trash. Don?t waste your money.
Never worked right from the beginning with only one sub hooked up it would shut on and off as if there was a short until I hit the top then it would stay on for 1020 minutes then start acting up again 3 out of the 4 channels would do it constantly as one would do it until i hit the top of the casing hard enough
First I?m a 60+ female and I did it all my self. Exception being lifting the TV to mount. The only thing I wish is that I had placed the mount about 3 or 4 inch?s down further on the wall..All in all I?m very happy with wall mount..When I get my cords organized I?ll post pic?s.. If I can install an one can...
This only works for three month and the bulb blow
Fits the bill.  Works great, easy to set up.  We are happy to have a working remote again.
Awesome earbuds. I?ve purchased these 3 times. Each pair lasting a little under a year which is fantastic considering the price. The sound quality is excellent and the volume toggle/microphone works well. I find the fit to be comfortable, especially because it comes with different sized rubber ring things to find your perfect fit. Will continue to purchase these as long as Sony makes them!
Great product.  Quick delivery.  And, the price was right.........
Arrived quickly and now my daughter can rock out again perfect!
They?re ok. A bit pricy for earphones like these. They fall out when you exercise.
I returned the unit because I found my old one and did not need it.
As far earbuds go, these are amazing, they sound espectacular, fit confortably in my ear, and best of all, will not fall when i am walking, jogging or running. So you may ask, why the poor rating, well, i?ve been using them for about two or three weeks, and last week the mic just stopped working, i tried running diagnostics on my phone  believing it could be the device, but everything turned out fine, then i try the same in my Relays and eventhoug my phone recognizes the michropone, the mic still did not work. so, it is a shame, the worst part is that  i was visiting the US, so, i can?t just returned to get a new pair(which i would love) becuase of the shipping cost, and there are no SOL REPUBLIC stores in the country or any other kind of vendor, this just sucks
It works
Arrived fast. The batteries hold a charge. I use them for my lamps when I ride my bicycle at night and haven?t had any issues
Buenas, excelente cable.
exactly the right cord and charger for my Compac laptop. no shipping delays
I received this as a free review sample five months ago and have sporadically used it on both a budget tablet that did not have bluetooth and on a few phones. What I like is has an internal battery that charges up and will power this speaker for at least five hours. What I dislike is the charging cable is not a standard USB micro, but a barrel connector type that is not easily replaced if the one that ships with this is lost or damaged. I subtracted a star from the rating because of that issue. The sound quality is more than acceptable considering the price and size of this speaker. The high, mid and low frequencies are nicely reproduced and the highs are not shrill. No, it isn?t audiophile quality, but it is good enough for casual listening. Plus it?s a LOT better than the internal speakers in my phone, tablets or even my laptop. If you have a nonbluetooth device (and there are surprisingly many tablets in this day and age that are not equipped with bluetooth) this speaker is an inexpensive solution.
Excellent product. Works really great!
The plugs worked well until one of them got stuck in the wall outlet and came apart when I tried to pull it out. It was unusable after that and I was not able to bring it home with me.
I love it! I paid $200 for a Beats Pill when they first came out and that came out to be a waste. This speaker has it all and it?s VERY lout not to mention waterproof. :)
Just what I was looking for to use for my business!
Great product. Worked great in Italy. Used for iPhones and iPads. Quality was good nice and sturdy
3rd time  buying these, they work great!
Nice crisp sound, decent bass response, and the &#34;Clear Voice&#34; is awesome for dialogue. This is an outstanding value and tremendous addition to our 32&#34; LG.
it is sooo bad, it doesn?t work smoothly even with the laptop and gives me a horrible noise
works like a mobile mouse.  works on Windows 10.  Great device
I did a lot of research on batteries before restocking, and I am glad I did. I had been using the bigger name brands you can get at the store before, and now that I have been using these, there is no way I?d go back. These batteries keep their charge for longer than any other battery I?d tried. Many of my other batteries I feel I have to charge twice as often. They charge quickly, and I can forget about them in my electronics for months before having to think about putting them back on the charger. It?s a few more bucks, but totally worth it.
Great product for the price.
it is a sata rev 3 cable and works fine no problems
Works great!
I was replacing a previous SEIKO 8000 small handheld fantastic help for my crosswords. It looked smart and had, apparently more functions than the one I bought as an urgent replacement which has no shut down cover; fewer functions and I paid more over the odds for an inferior object.I daily see the same object I have advertised much cheaper than I paid. Daily I get frustrated with the lack nof info available on this object. The firm that delivered it did it swiftly as I paid extra for that  but I have the feeling I was taken for a ride by what I paid for it.. good for them.
Great sound from a cheap little speaker. We use them in multiple conference rooms.
Bought a pair of these through my school and was completely disappointed. First of all the sound was dismal. There was a very small range and the quality was subpar. Along with this, the bass was almost nonexistent and the sound got worse over the two months I used them. After about two months the casing started falling apart until I could not actually use them anymore. These are nothing but &#34;designer&#34; headphones trying to get you to pay more for a brand name, same thing as beats.
Really really good product, I can only recommend it. There is nothing better than showering and listening to your favorite music :)
It?s doing what I bought it to do  it?s charging my computer. It also didn?t take very long to receive. Yay!
Loved the look and small footprint, but the sound was tinny and the unit failed after only 2 weeks.
a
Dope
As advertised
These headphones are amazing! My 4 year old son loves them they have great sound and stay charged for a very long time. I would absolutely buy them again and recommend them to anyone!!
Good value. Ships from China, reasonable shipping time.
I bought these as a gift but they looked pretty well built and substantial. The item felt fairly heavy in the packaging so I?m not sure how comfortable it would be to wear it for longer periods of time.
These are a high grade battery discharged in accordance with the manufactures suggested method should provide good service.
Great product. Excellent price. Easy assembly. Thanks.
Exactly as described. Fit my Bose earphones like factory new. Good quality and easy to install. Makes them look and feel like new again for a reasonable price.
the batteries were great and delivered in 2 days
Works great much more than I expected!!!
Arrived quickly!  Working great!
WE LOVE IT!
I?m so happy with this deck, i have had a couple aftermarket radios and have installed a couple, this has been by far the best as far as installation and appearance! It?s clean, it?s fast, Bluetooth connects everytime i hop in my truck! Over all I?m extremely happy!
There is absolutely nothing wrong with this surge protector with the 25 foot cord. The only reason for 4 start instead of 5 is the fact that I bought a standing one, that is perfect for my wide chargers. If I could merge the two together it would be perfection.
good product
This unit was not too hard to assemble. I installed it in my attic and it seems to pick up the local networks pretty well.
Item received as described. Thank you.
This is a cute little clock, but the one I got lost time rapidly.  You could watch the second hand stop and pause every few seconds. I returned it and am still looking for a cheap clock that keeps good time.
Perfect size for my portable battery and cable. My portable battery has a flush button which could get turned on if something touches it in my purse. I was specifically looking for a hard case to secure the battery in place to make sure nothing touches the button as I move around. The case is light weight and not too big to slip into my purse.   I like the color (brown), too  looks nice.
I was a big fan of HK and my love for HK started with audio system in my BMW. With that experience, I bought this sound bar for an apartment living and this is truly the biggest failure and the worst decisions I have ever made. Many of my friends started looking for sound bars,since I already bought this piece, they started asking me for my review and I suggested them to go look for some other brand except HK. So one of my friend ended buying  Bose and other one ended up buying Sonos. The moment I heard those systems,both of them have completely thrown me off and I liked Sonos the most. Second  biggest UPSET, CUSTOMER SERVICE. I have never expected from HK having such a sloppy and nasty customer service. This is my last visit to HK and I will never buy nor recommend any of my friends buying HK products. You have to take a serious action pretty soon and failure in doing so will lead to RIP HK...... GOOD BY FOR EVER........
Could never get it to work
This fits the outlets in Brazil perfectly.  The multiple outlets are also very helpful.
This is a worthless product. It worked decently for a little while. However, it just melted yesterday while I was charging it.
Did not work with PTouch PTD200.  Adapter is 9V but only 1Amp. The Brother AD24ES power adapter is 9Volt and 1.6Amp.  When I tried to use this AC Adapter, the PTouch read &#34;Battery Dead&#34; due to the insufficient amperage. Returning adapter. By the way, THANK YOU BROTHER FOR NOT INCLUDING AN AC ADAPTER WITH YOUR LABEL PRINTER!!!!!  I?m really enjoying hunting around for an AC adapter as if there is not enough minutia in life already to deal with.
Good build quality, LOVE the low profile fit.
Wish I could give 0 stars. The wind destroyed this after a few weeks. First week or so, the aluminum loop in the back, ripped and fell off. The plastic rotor area broke a week later. The remote for the rotor works on similar frequencies as other remote controls. Everytime we?d scroll through Netflix or turn volume up/down  the antenna would move. Since there?s no position indicator, takes a bit too reposition the antenna. All things considered, I can find no reason to purchase this model. Other similar antennas might be better.
Works great on my 52&#34; TV.  It is still hanging on the wall.  I put it up by myself, but would be easier with a 2nd set of hands.
The adhesive wore out after just a few weeks and it fell off the back of my TV!
Not much to say here, nice case for my Bose noise cancellation earphones.
Good sound, easy to work. Charge lasts well. Seem solidly made.
Great antenna. Picked up 47 Digital channels in San Antonio. Easy to mount.
This is great! its super easy to install and it rotates easy in nearly every angle that you want it to. i love it!
Love it
One family member had one and loved it.  The next family member had to have one.  So we have two.  No complaints.  Used in small dorm room, outside for party.  Very useful
great value
Not good at all.
On time and good quality.
5 stars for: Comfortable surface, matching metallic color, precision fit, great protection, easy to install. The packaging actually discourages you from using the protector on the touchpad, so it is really just for the palm rest area. Overall, very pleased
Fabulous waterproof headphones. Great sound. Make sure you put them in prior to getting in the water. Only drawback is the cord is to long, but I knew that when I bought them. Compatible with waterproof iPod Shuffle.
Awful quality the ear pieces (the mesh cover, the inside bits, all of them) start falling apart within a week of light uses Buy another brand! Waste of money.
Definitely better than the 25 mile version, the pictures aren?t grainy and it seems to receive reception better. However, there is one flaw and I cannot figure out why even this one won?t pick PBS up. The broadcasting tower is well within the reach of the antennas, both the 25 mile and this one. According to antenna finding websites the PBS broadcasting tower is 78 miles near my home and yet the 25 mile antenna did not pick it up and neither does this one. But if you must purchase an antenna I highly recommend this one over the 25 mile one. This one doesn?t drop channels and it does not show them grainy.
Unbelievable sound quality.  We almost never turn it off!!!!
ok
Great purchase, was as expected
find another surge protector with 12foot capability. you won?t. also coaxial connections. ggwp. loved installing it, would buy again.
setting the alarms takes a little getting used to but is seems fine so far Thanks
They stick to whatever you want and cables don?t slip out
This is made to look like quality, but it isn?t.  The weaving came off one of the ends, apparently it only served as decoration.  The actual fiber optics are plastic, and were slightly warped, too.  You can find much better elsewhere.
Exactly what I hoped for, even better actually. This does exactly what it should: charges quickly, connects easily, plays loudly, tolerates being wet.
Bought this for my kid who was asking for exorbitantly priced namebrand headphones but I decided to get these instead as they seemed to offer excellent value for money. Kid has been using them for over six months now and is very happy with both the sound and the looks. As a bonus, kid now admits that the namebrand headphones are clearly overpriced (so +1 points to these headphones for the implicit economics lesson).
The pattern is exactly I want yet the slots are too tight. Need to push my plugs hard.
I purchased this transformer for a baby blender. It doesn?t have enough amps nor are they anywhere listed on the transformer or the specs. So basically it?s useless to me.
great
Hmmm, this may well be my first bad review.... This product broke after less than 2 months. Opening the unit reveals the problem....the Headphone Jack secured to the motherboard with two dabs of hot glue? WTF!!! HOT GLUE to hold a working jack to the motherboard it about as POS as electronics come. Wait.... wait....  I suppose they could have used rubber cement or elmers glue!! Oh, yes... the BT connection dropss you and reconnects frequently. Annnnnnd, unlike every other BT product, I keep having to readd/reauth this device with my phone. Verdict: Top Grade POS! Do Not Purchase this product!
Price is right but the sound is pretty bad.
I was super excited to get this MP3/MP4 Player, as I have a grand daughter who LOVES music and is always asking for the tablet, so she can get on Pandora.  I took this out of the box, plugged it up, charged it, and then turned it on.  One I figured out how to use it, I decided it was best to just let her use the FM Radio part of the player and then I would put music on it at a later point.  She played with it for about an hour maybe two, and it needed to be charged again.  The problem is , it won?t charge!  I have no idea why it won?t charge now, as it charged when I first got it.  But it won?t.  I was really disappointed in it.  Please know that everything that I have written about this product is how I really feel about it and you can read my reviews with confidence.  I received this product complimentary and this is my honest and unbiased review  Keep in mind that all  thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.
just as offered perfect size for my computer bag.
These are great headphones, I did a lot of searching and even sent back some Seinheisers that didn?t have what I was looking for. Let me make one thing clear, the quality of this headphone can be replicated by cheaper headphones, BUT... not if you amp them. I went 2 months without an amp and they were great, dug real low on movies with bass and, well there are other reviews about the awesome sound but frankly it?s a flat EQ (which was done on purpose and is a good thing) but I bought them for their bass capabilities not for their ability to replicate audio without ?tarnishing? it. I used a Fiio E17k and these things WOKE UP. You can adjust the bass, treble, and whatnot to remain flat and even then these things sound better. Add +4 or +6 to the bass EQ though and these are FUN.   Some people mention that when you get high end headphones like these and an amp it just makes bad music stick out more, it is unfortunately very true. I can immediately tell which tracks on my ipod or on Youtube were downloaded at low quality, it?s painful to listen to... but it?s completely worth it when you find good HQ tracks because these babies put you in the studio. Bass guitars have concert like depth, highs are not shrill, the amp completely brings back the mids that some people have complained about not being up to par, and if you throw on techno/trap/rap ... if you?re into that sort of thing... the D600s are thrilling. ss...   Long story short, these are great by themselves, but if you want to actually experience them the way they are meant to be experienced, and have some hard hitting (not distorted or overbearing) bass GET THEM with an AMP!!!! Sidenote, I almost didn?t buy these because of a negative review about the headband being uncomfortable, but I have a buzzcut, a normal sized/shaped head ( I think ) and I have these on for hours at a time with no trouble. They are in fact extremely comfortable and I?ve never had to take them off out of annoyance.
Just what we needed, the remote works great.
Does the job.
Good while it lasted. It stopped working after about 3 months.
These things sound so much better than most small headphones, and WAY better than any in ear headphones.
It works, what else can you ask for?
I?ve been dealing with the HCCA since 2010 and I love this line. I?ve had 2 15?s in my suburban and now ima put 2 12?s in my car. Sundown audio is a good brand as well and may be better than orion, but you will be paying 500 (at least) for a sub. If this sub doesn?t have as much bass as expected either you need a better built box or a stronger amp.
as described.  sturdy and functional. 70 inch LED securely mounted.
Perfect
It?s APC, what else is there to say. Great price over brick and mortar stores.
This Cat5e seems pretty cheap, internal wire braids are loose, jacket is very big for the wires. Next time I?ll look for something else but this will work as a phone line
This is really value for money. have it for 2 yrs already and it?s still working great!
Comcast fried our modem and tv this summer.  TV was on a Monster surge protector, but the line transmitted the surge and fried the poweron module.  This has no degradation to signal  comcast cannot see or control it and provides the affordable protection we need.
Heavy Duty item that exceeded my hopes, a great value for the price.
These are great if you never plan on getting any amount of moisture anywhere near them. Sweat, drizzle, pretty much anything makes them spazz out.
best for your money.
Another great buy  it plays all kinds of CD formats whereas our Bang & Olufsen doesn?t. Good sound quality  great price!
it didnt work for me.still cant watch DVDs on Blu Ray after using product.when I put DVD in it says No Disc..this was 3rd lens cleaner I have purchased I dont think its lens thats dirty.mY b something else.Its 3 yrs old
Last year, I finally transitioned to a flat screen TV.  It wasn?t new, but it was new to me.  Until then, I wasn?t really sure what all of the whole HDMI thing was about.  It just looks like a fatter USB plug if you don?t have HDMI.  Imagine my surprise when my older electronics also needed to be replaced with newer ones and they all required or suggested an HDMI connection.  That?s great, if your TV has more than one HDMI port! My older TV works beautifully, so I couldn?t justify buying another TV just to get more HDMI ports.  After looking around, I found several brands of multiport HDMI plug and play units.  I decided on the HausBell 3Port High Speed HDMI Switch 3In1Out (Hdmi V1.3) Intelligent 1080P AC Power adapter. I was nervous about setting this up, but it was easy and fast.  It literally took about 2 minutes from the time I took it out of the package until I was watching TV using the HausBell 3Port High Speed HDMI Switch 3In1Out Intelligent 1080P AC Power adapter.  I plugged my Apple TV into the adapter and the adapter into the back of my TV.  I switched the TV and Apple TV back on but the Apple TV didn?t switch on.  I moved the Apple TV to the second port on the adapter and it was fully functional. The picture quality is as good as it was when I had the Apple TV connected directly to the TV.  I may now brave up and hook up the DVD player next. Disclosure: I was provided with a free or discounted product in order to review this item. However, this did not influence my review. All opinions are true and my own.
An antenna is hardly an exciting product. So all I can say is this one just works as advertised. It is seems to be sturdy and well made. I like the clear backing and white cable as it matches almost any decor. I have three more TV?s and will be buying more of these.
Aweful quality, one ear did not work within 3 weeks of very light uses buy another brand...my in ear Moki one also broke, even earier will not buy this brand again
Loved!!!
Works great. I use this to connect a Canon Vixia camera to an HDMI splitter. That signal is sent to multiple TVs to live stream speakers and singers. WORD OF ADVICE: Check your device to see which way the port is turned. I thought this cord would plug in and hang, but the port on the camera is flipped. For application the cable goes up and over the top of the camera then back down.
The ticking is unobtrusive and it rings loud enough when I need it to.
Worked well for my application. Couple things to keep in mind:  The edges are as sharp as razor blades. Wear adequate hand protection. I had some deep cuts before I smartened up.  You can get these ties tight but they are not zip ties.  It is very easy to damage/distort the ball bearing housing while tightening. If that happens, the tie won?t tighten and you have to start over with a new one.  Amazon sells a tensioning tool for these ties. I purchased it and save your money. To tighten, I used a pair of wire clippers and a flat head screwdriver. Manually tighten the tie until you can?t tighten any more. Clamp the wire clippers on the extra length of tie near the ball bearing housing. Take your flat head, rest against the wire clippers, and gently push the ball bearing housing further up the tie. Snipe off the excess tie.  It has been over a month and none of the ties have loosened.
The Onh HDTV Indoor Antenna works great. I purchased this in conjunction with the Onh Low Noise HDTV Antenna Amplifier Signal High Gain Booster. The combination is bringing me 49 channels with excellent picture and sound quality.  We are located 35 to 40 miles from the broadcast towers. The antenna is mounted in a window at about six feet above the floor. We use a splitter to connect two TVs to the one antenna with no loss of picture integrity. Highly recommend this system for those who want to cut the cable. I purchased this HDTV Indoor Antenna at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.
Very thick durable cable...  Not your regular cable.  Very high quality!
Great, found my original but will keep for a backup
Worked as intended! Very happy with this.
great product, works as intented.  Much more thin than most standard cables.  Price is very competitive.
Very well charger works great!
Woooow
This is perfect size and the sound is amazing! I love how portable it is.  I use it as a replacement for my laptop speakers I bought that aren?t as loud or clear as this. So glad I bought it!
Good quality, Great price, Fast shipping.
These are good discs, worked well with my Liteon burners, and came at a competitive price.
Works great with my Sony STRDH550 receiver.
works as expected, although the instructions are in Japanese.  so I had a Japanese friend translate them, and they really don?t say much other than to turn it on plug something in the jack.
These little plastic pieces slide right on the Fitbit and keep it in place. No worries about the Fitbit clasp coming loose and the Fitbit falling off.
This is a great value. Got a new computer and needed something fast. I previously ordered something similar for twice as much. This is just as high quality. I am very pleased with it.
Worked perfect!
Bass is good for the open box price...but the sub was defective, danced on the floor and untold able distortion from 2/3 volume up. Return was not a problem, but sending defective sub was wrong, shown no initial quality control.
Bad quality, the ear phones hurt the ear if you run with them on The rubber holds were very loose to begin with and did not help during exercise
Works Great
This product is durable, the sound quality is excellent, and you cannot beat the price. I?ve been spending too much money on inferior products and so glad I came across these Philip ear buds.
Ideal for small office or home use.
Fantastic little speaker. I have two of them mounted in my boats TTop. They connect to my radio via Bluetooth. Added an adapter to my builtin radio to allow it to connect up to two Bluetooth speakers simultaneously.  Saved me the trouble or snaking wires through my boat just to connect 2 low  quality speakers.
Works Great!  Great price and very solid.  The connections are good and easy to twist. The length is exactly what I needed.
The product is not for the Garmin 255. The cable has a different entrance.
This was a gift and the recipient loves it!  Not bulky, perfect size for a pocket, has a sturdy clip.  It holds a lot of music!
These headphones have great sound, block out outside noises, feel very durable and came with their own carrying case. I was very happy with the quick delivery and excellent price. Since the price was so low, I decided to buy two sets  thinking that they would be somewhat disposable. These seem as though they will be long lasting and I can probably give one of the sets away to a friend.
good product, it works very well but it is just so heavy
No response, right out of the packet. With a tested 2.4A power supply, no picture is produced (not even a black picture, simply no signal; tested with a signal cleaner). There wasn?t even a switch where the NTSC/PAL switch was meant to be.
Very nice.  Long lasting battery.  Loud  could hear it more than 50 yards away clearly.  Very impressed.
Perfect...exactly what I was looking for.
This has replaced our regular radio and did so easily. Frankly put, Internet radio is where radio is today. Not only do many commercial stations have an Internet feed, but many Internet only stations exist some of which are commercial free. For us, the chief joy of this device over the old tech which only receives local signals is that we can get stations from all over the world. This allows us to listen to shows we could never expect to get locally plus we listen Internationally. Those guys in Zimbabwe really rock out. Once you try this, you?ll see how limited regular radio  even subscriber radio such as Sirius  is. Let me say this: if you think the news is reflected by the US outlets such as CNN, Fox, MSHAHA or whatever, you are missing a lot. This is a huge heavy device with a relatively small nontouch screen. Setup isn?t difficult except make sure your ISP opens Port 80 before you start. This is usually closed by default. Once online, you register your unit with Grace and you?re off and running. The sound is decent if not great. There is a built in equalizer if you want to make your own output bias so the complaints here about lack of bass are, to me, baseless. Boost the bass if you want. We have ours hooked to a pair of JBL speakers through a homemade little 20w amp which makes the sound quite nice. You can get such amps for less than $20 from all the usual suspects. The device comes complete to hook into a few services notably Pandora. Browsing through the huge selections of Internet stations is daunting using the radio itself. This is made much easier using the iOS or Android (Windows phones don?t apply) app available for free at the usual outlets. We use iOS here and found the app to be sluggish and annoying on two iPhone 6?s but quite useful on iPads G3 and G5. Programming presets and browsing the Internet is so much easier using the app that I doubt one would much enjoy this device having to navigate by relying on the small screen located in the radio. The remote works well but is limited to LOS being infrared. I?d really like to have seen a larger screen located on top of the unit which is touch capable and the addition of Bluetooth. It does have a headphone output but wired only. Yes, I can get a Bluetooth adapter to fit the 3.5 mm headphone jack but today Bluetooth is pretty common. Overall we?re highly pleased with our purchase and would surely do it again.vice having to navigate by relying on the small screen located in the radio.

This device replaced a much larger unit I previously purchased.  It is compact, easy to use and even includes the Australian standard.  I would buy another in a flash!!!  I highly recommend this adapter!!!
Keyboard side stopped working in less than a year. Was great when it worked, but otherwise it?s just a bulky remote.
This is the second set of these batteries we have bought. The first set lasted approximately 4 years. If these do as well I will have no complaint.
Very comfortable but rather big. Excellent sound quality. I don?t think the Bass Boost really adds anything to the experience. I do wish they had noise canceling technology. Overall a great buy
Excellent sound and overall product design. A quality, compact speaker. The plugin base and portability with Lithium Ion battery is a convenient feature. Setup via their free app was easy. The AirPlay feature requires excellent wifi speed, if not, playback will be choppy (a limitation of all AirPlay devices in my experience). Overall documentation is good, not great. Voice prompts on device when connecting it to the wireless network are loud and some intelligible with no option to lower the volume. I was so pleased with the quality of the product I bought a second one.
Worked great in Singapore & Bali, having the 2 plugs plus the USB was very convenient.
great price
Works perfect. Very tight connection not loose like a lot of other products. Definitely recommend
Everything works but the sound quality is rather poor.  Better if played through headphones, but basically does everything it says on the tin in a tiny, attractive package.  Bought for my mother so she could listen to her LPs and she loves it as it is very easy to use and doesn?t take up much space.
Had everything I needed to install my new tv. I love it.
Simple, straightforward  folded dipole, but works just great in my newly remodeled A/V room with surround audio setup.
Not large enough for some game consoles.  My PS3 doesn?t fit on it.
don?t buy it, it works for only 1 week
Received the bulbs 2 day before they were supposed to be delivered and are working as specified.
It is a nice MP3, my husband likes it cause it is small enough to put in his pocket at work and the sound is great.
I think that these are, by far, the best headphones I?ve tried...and over time, I?ve tried many brands. They are comfortable and the sound comes through perfectly. I lent them to my 16 year old son for his recommendation and had to nearly fight to get them back!
These pair fine with iphone and the work listening to music just fine.  They appear to pair with my laptop also, as evidenced by the bluetooh device manager, but will not play audio.  Sure I must be missing something and may be just a matter of finding the troubleshooting magic, BUT it should not be this difficult!
fast delivery and worked good
worked for a bit, after 4 weeks no sound. the wire is too thin, rips easily .
Arrived quickly and works fine.
does not work with fire
I?ve never before indulged in Bose, but these are worth the price3 for a good basic earphone that is just... quality. This is a wonderfully sturdy set that I feel I can actually use without fearing any ripping or obnoxious tangling or good ol? falling apart after a week. The sound quality is incredible to boot, the ear pieces comfortable (something I have always struggled with concerning ear phones.) Great set, highly recommended.
Just heavy enough to sit on your desk without the cord pulling it down, but still easy to move around as needed. 10/10, does exactly what it should. Update: I do with it was a little heavier or had some kind of adhesive/sticky to keep it from moving around as much.
Awesome, really good sound quality and volume without too much sound pollution
This CD / DVD and VCR stand was easy to assemble (no tools needed); so I was very pleased.  It looks nice and takes up very little space.  Great for an apartment.
Great batteries.
I Love It, Everyone I show it to, wants one
This thing is ridiculous. It?s super loud for how small it is. I live in a 3bedroom apartment, and this fills the whole place when you have it turned up.
Blub lasted only 1 month!!!  Do not purchase!!!
Worked perfectly
Perfect little strip for any charging station. Great for trips too! Took it to the beach for our family trip and it was used by everyone to recharge their devices from tablets to portable speakers. Very convenient.
It works well with PC, however, it ahs lag with Mac book pro. :(
I like them came on time just what I ordered it was a fair price
Not a bad product but a little flimsy on the steel mounting bracket. This bracket also does not fit a Samsung 32&#34; UN32J5500AFXZA. I had to cut the brackets with a band saw so they wouldn?t stick up above the TV. The price was cheap so its not a deal breaker for me.
Good cables. I like the look of them, and they do their job.
Good quality
I?ve had these for about a year and a half. I got them paired with a Yamaha RXV375 and cannot be happier. The quality, sound wise, compared to the price I paid for these back in December of 2013 is unremarkable. In the time i?ve owned this set i have not experienced any issue at all. Highly recommend this product !
I believe in terms of other products, this is fairly easy to install. Once the TV is attached it doesn?t tilt as much as I would like but does slide left to right with ease. Very secure, can rest assured that if installed properly, your TV will not be going anywhere.
The Sangean ANT60 antenna is good for what it is and performs as it should. One came packed with my excellent Sangean ATS909X multiband radio. What is it? ANT60 is a 23? random wire antenna that reels into a spool like a measuring tape. That makes it easy to pack and carry around. It has a 3.5mm plug that fits into the external antenna socket on many portable shortwave radios. This plug is the same as a 1/8&#34; mono audio plug available as an electronics part from electronics stores like Radio Shack. The ANT60 includes an alligator clip adaptor that allows the user to connect the ANT60 center plug pin to the whip antenna of radios that do not feature an external 3.5mm1/8&#34;antenna jack. ANT60 also includes a strap and clip for hanging the far end of the antenna. ANT60 is nice as a portable antenna for temporary setups. I pack mine when traveling or when using the radio on the boat.  A random wire antenna will provide useful signal gain over a builtin telescopic whip SW antenna if the wire is long enough for the frequency to be received. The ANT60 is long enough to provide excellent gain for SW frequencies over 12.0 MHz. For frequencies lower than that don?t expect quite as much gain. For an example from my location nnear the US west coast, Radio Australia at 17.840 MHz late afternoons and evenings comes in two or three times stronger with ANT60 compared to using the builtin whip antenna on the Sangean ATS909X. But, listening to Radio Havana Cuba during the evening at the lower frequency of 6.100 MHz may only be 50% to two times stronger with ANT60 compared to the whip antenna. The ANT60 doesn?t do quite as well at lower frequencies due to it?s relatively short length. The builtin ferrite bar antennas found on most multiband portables will do a better job for AM band (MW) radio which is much lower in frequency than SW. ANT60 works best with SW.   The ANT60 antenna should be hung horizontally and as high off the ground as convenient. Six to eightfeet off the ground will do fine. The direction isn?t that critical at this low height off the ground. No need to string it up tightly, a little sag in the wire won?t hurt. Random wire antennas work best if you use them outdoors. They can work well inside wooden framed houses. You can also use a random wire antenna indoors by running most of the wire outdoors through a window or doorway.  ANT60 may be purchased for under $15 and sometimes for under $10. Keep in mind that for $25 you can buy 75? or more of 18 gauge insulated copper wire, a 1/8&#34; mono audio plug and some mounting hardware and have a permanent random wire antenna that will run circles around the ANT60 at all SW frequencies down to 3.0 MHz and maybe below that. I use a 120? random wire at home mounted eight feet off the ground. That antenna rocks.  Keep in mind that quite a few user/reviewers and blog reviewers of short wave gear do not understand shortwave radio very well. SW reception is always better with outdoor antennas. Areas located in &#34;the boonies&#34; often offer the best reception of all because they are located away from electronic devices that cause RFI (radio frequency interference) with shortwave receivers. Those new to shortwave may also not understand that certain times of day offer better shortwave reception than others and that most shortwave bands work better at certain times of day than others. Inexpensive portable shortwave radios priced under $150 are likely to offer performance that is limited, at best. Cheap radios often rely too much on amplified antenna gain from a whip antenna and may overload if a longer external antenna like ANT60 is attached.  For welldesigned shortwave radios (portable or tabletop) the ANT60 will work better than a builtin whip antenna. The reelup feature is a nice convenience.
Awesome
excellent
Never seen one of these before, but we love it!  Works perfectly!
The best device for swimming. Two (2)  gigabytes of space for music, a book, or whatever you like listening to. This device has help me to become a better lap swimmer. Couldn?t say enough good things about this. That is how satisfied I am.
My man is always on the lookout for tech items to enhance our tv and stereo sound. We normally use those red /white cords. .you know the ones they don?t really give the best sound. So these are RCA cables with males on both ends. The Oxygen Free Copper Lines give maximum audio quality while the 24K gold plated full metal connectors prevent corrosion on themselves. Our movies and music sound better then ever. In the spirit of full disclosure,I received this product free in exchange for my review.
These earphones are cheap but they?re great! So you actually get more than what you pay for... The bass is excellent!
Received very quickly and works great! No problems so far!
Great value
excelent
Purchased for the high surge resistance.  Love it for the plugs that move to match to odd angles I have behind my home entertainment system.
Works as published
Easy to set up and replaces a $100+ remote with no issue.
Terrible product. Can?t actually turn off the setting for the alarm so we had to set it for the middle of the afternoon just so it wouldn?t disturb us at night. The labels for the knobs are so small they are almost impossible to read. It?s going to Goodwill, I bought a better one
Really like this brand and have used it for a long time. It delivers a consistent result, which is what I am looking for.
Worked great!  As advertized
I honestly love this product I?ve had it over a year and it still good it holds good and it?s good for it price
I gave it as a gift. They said they loved it.
Easy assembly! Works great!
Good substitute for the original. Took some time to get the right fit but when you get it right, it?s nice.
This thing is super portable, and sounds amazing.
Quality!! And has a powerful sound!!
works great we watch a lot of movies
Great plugs, they work well. I m really tuff on my cables. So far so good. And it?s great to have a back up plug ready to go. Just in case something goes wrong.
This worked for maybe a week.
Perfect item for what our company needs for an upcoming event.  Very pleased.
Works better than I could?ve hoped for. If you didn?t know the signal was split, this box won?t tip you off.
Great cable. Fits my HD598s perfectly and the red cable with black sleeving matches the brown on the headset much better than the black cable that came with the headphones. The included 1/4&#34; screwon adapter is very high quality and the springstyle is a unique touch that matches the connectors very well. Definitely a great upgrade if you want something that looks or feels different from the stock cable or need a replacement cable. This cable is the perfect length to listen to music with my phone in my pocket and not have a ton of extra cable spilling out of my pockets like spaghetti.
I?ve owned 3 different types of Bose inear headphones, ranging in price from 100.00 to $150.00, I love everything Bose, but I?m hear to tell you, these Zipbuds are all you?ll ever need. And they?re 35 bucks. My challenge to the brand shoppers like me, the next time your 100.00 plus headphones go down, do yourself a favor and try these. They fit well, they really are &#34;no tangle&#34;, the zip concept is great, and of course the most important part, the sound... the dynamics are very good. The base thumps, and honestly, the mid range to highs are better than the Bose. Heck I can get 3 pairs of these and get change back or 1 pair of the Bose. Now that I know how good they are, I?ll probably get another color too. FOLKS, TRY THESE HEADPHONES. You can pay more, but you?ll be hard pressed to get a better headphone.
For the price, very good set of headphones!  They sound better than the Bose 20i that i am returning.  My only complaint is that they don?t have buttons to control music & phone.
Loved the quality of sound, but these are a bad investment. Save your money! The wires disintegrate rather quickly. Forget about using these to workout out. At first I noticed a crack in one area and thought it was not a big deal, but shortly after I started seeing cracks all over the cord on the right headphone. I felt beaten down, wasted $100 at the time and got nothing to show for it.
We purchased this speaker because of it?s small size, relatively small price, and positive reviews. We wanted to listen to music in the backyard while cleaning up or gardening and wanted something that was durable, portable, and water resistant. This met our needs and then some. We have used it outdoors while barbecuing and indoors while cooking and cleaning and it is great not worrying about cords. It just syncs with the phone and music plays. Simple.
The Grado SR80Es have earned a spot on BoldList?s Top 5 Grado Headphones list!    Pros:   Adjustable, soft vinyl headband   Superb sound quality   Large ear cushions for comfortable listening    Check out the rest of the list: [...]
Worked good until my daughter broke the wire in less than 6 months. I don?t know if they can make the wires stronger for kids products.
Have used it several times and it seems to work perfectly.
Got my 80?s Technics SL220 up and running after decades of being idol.
Poor material quality; breaks easily
Well made cable. Just as described in description. Will be buying more at various lengths to organize my rack.
This system works great! It sounds awesome outside for a cookout, or inside for a party or enjoying some music in the kitchen. It plays really loud, but the sound is great quality. The remote is very convenient and I have had no problems at all with this system. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a system that isn?t too hightech, it doesn?t have any extra speakers or wires. You can plug any phone into the back with an audio wire so that it can play from anything with a headphone jack.
Headphones work great but they sent me a messed up cord. $140 for headphones ud think the quality would back up the price
Sticks to surfaces well, a little difficult to fit cords into though. I love the colors!
Awesome deal...USB port permits flash drive operation for audio files.
Works great!! It really exceeded my expectations.
I have a large house (7000sqft) , and I can hook these headphones to my iPhone, and walk anywhere on the same floor and not lose connection. I just bought these for running/skating/biking but they have turned into an everyday thing. The sound is so great, I don?t even want to listen to my iPhone anymore through just the iPhone speakers. I was also a staunch supporter of &#34;in the ear&#34; headphones, as I thought these would slip off, or not fit my skinny face. Also not the case! I wear glasses (size 49 if you wear glasses you know it?s skinny:)),  and they go together fine, no issues there either. Great buy, so happy!
Fast delivery, as described.
I am a professional installer of audio video equipment and I am thoroughly impressed with this mount. It is my first time purchasing from Echo Gear, and it will certainly not be my last. This mount is built to survive world war 3. On an installation scale, I would not recommend anyone without solid mechanical knowledge to get this thing mounted to the wall however, because it does have some weight to it. This is meant for someone who wants it done right. Cheers EchoGear, thank you for an excellent product. Daniel Zuzevich President Intelligent Electrical Systems www.iesystemscorp.com
Cable looks, works, and functions great.  It?s a little stiff though.  I knew going in that it would be more stiff being braided cables, but it is quite a bit more stiff than I anticipated, which is mainly an issue behind the TV where I want to make a couple bends to keep the wire hidden.  I will eventually put HDMI through my walls and just use this as a spare long cable as needed for connecting a laptop, setting a TV outside, and other temporary uses. UPDATE  I increased my review from 4 to 5 stars because really the cables are great and very rugged, which is why they may not be as flexible as other cables.  Also after leaving a nice professional review I was contacted by the company to thank me for the review and I really like to see a company go that extra mile and listen to the feedback they are getting.  That in itself would be worth a 6/5 star rating if I could.
Yes they work good, will buy more
Seems to work well. Only used it once on my cruise but it performed well.
Good
The sound is VERY good & for a little speaker, It is the best I?ve heard from anything this small and is worth buying. Only brands I have heard that sound as good have started with a &#34;B&#34; and cost way more (although they are louder). I took 2 stars off for 2 reasons: 1, I wish it was louder. Using this on a pontoon boat, and even when just floating the people in the front cant hear it good. 2, you cant pair more than 1 of these to a device at a time! Even with my kids crappy little dollar store specials he can run 3 of them simultaneously. Adding the ability to do that would take care of the 1st complaint too so to me it?s crazy that they dont have this ability.
The sound is pretty good; most important; it works for BlackBerry!! You can put any place, does not need wide places. Just make sure not block the reception to avoid static sound.
I was very happy with this mount for my situation. I mounted a 50&#34; Vizio to it that is about 35 lbs. No issues at all with the weight and it moves easily just as I needed.
Works great, but the bolt that attaches the screen mount to the swing arm  has the nut on top. If the nut works free the bolt will fall out causing the screen to drop.
Work great
I couldn?t get it to work on my phones or my wife?s.
Was exactly what I was looking for.
Very sturdy and durable construction.  Will stand up to the abuse i give it in the gym and out riding my bike.
Works really well, even on the first floor of my building.  On the second floor, it gets even more stations.
Got signal great didn?t hold up very long
Works as expected
I would not recommending on purchasing this product. The NFC connection is nice, but the sound quality is horrible. No matter of the volume level, the sound crackles.
Not much to say about CD cases, but they arrived quickly after ordering, are as stated, and I?m satisfied.
good
It doesn?t pick up the chanels very clearly.  It waves in ans out.
Clear and powerful on 19v 5a laptop brick. Hum free and no discernible distortion at high power. It?s tiny and has a professional, nongimicky appearance.  I?d buy it again.
unfortunately I bought this a few months before my trip so I am unable to return it. It failed immediately upon my first use, blowing out part of the unit through the left side. I used something similar from Radio Shack for several years until it was dropped and broken. If you are going to  take a chance on this buy it shortly before you need it so it can be returned if it fails.
It died after a couple months use!
Not much to be said about this extension cord other than it uses sturdy, quality connectors. Only problem for me: I was looking for an extension cord with a very thin plug that would fit through the tight opening of a phone battery case, and I was hoping this one would  it doesn?t, even after removing the screwedin plug cover. Since it?s not advertised as such, I see no reason to lower the rating of an otherwise good cable, but in case you?re looking for a headphone cord that can replace the pigtail that came with a phone battery case, this is not it.
Purchased this due to the high amazon reviews.  This is my third Onkyo receiver. For the first few weeks, I was impressed, lots of HDMI inputs, good sound quality, etc.  Approximately one month after owning, I would get intermittent video drop outs lasting 12 seconds. This happened maybe once every hours. Not a huge deal. Fast forawrd to 6 months and am now getting these every 5 seconds, each time lasting for 12 seconds. Can?t watch anything due to this issue. I tried changing cables, changing inputs and even trying it on a small TV.  Nothing seems to work.  Called Onkyo who told me to take it to a local repair shop. After a week at the shop, I find out that this is not covered under warranty as I had purchased it from Focus Camera (resller on amazon) and not amazon.com. I now have a 40 lb paperweight that I need to replace.  Remember, you get what you pay for.
Everything on this order was fine. I got a great product at a great price. Well packaged and fast shipment. My Mother Loves it
These work great for storing photo CDs at the back of my scrapbooks. The backing is easy to peel off and the adhesive sticks well to the surface but doesn?t grab on so quickly that you have to be quick to position it. I had hoped to find a bundle of 50 but it was worth getting the 100 pcs because they work exactly how I had hoped.
Just as the title states, this is an awesome wireless speaker! This product is tinier than expected and measures 2.5&#34; wide by 2&#34; tall. Here are the features this speaker can do below. This product also contains a charging/Linein cord and a handy little velvet bag for safe traveling. * Bluetooth pairing to listen to music (Both Pandora and Spotify worked flawless for me, as well as music downloaded onto my phone) * Hands Free calling via Bluetooth * Play music via the microSD card (Supports up to 64GB) * FM Tuner (Another feature that worked perfect for me) * Music via Linein mode * NFC pairing (Didn?t work for me, see below) These are a ton of features that are available for this speaker. Everything worked well beyond my expectation minus the NFC pairing. For some reason, I couldn?t pair my phone to the speaker using NFC. It could have been the phone case I?m using, but I didn?t make too much effort to try and get it working. I prefer bluetooth over NFC anyways, so this wasn?t a big deal. I?m confident if I contacted the support people, they could have fixed my problem. Some other cool features I like are the semisticky surface on the bottom of the speaker. This will definitely help against slipping away. Also, I like the way the volume/tuner work.  A quick press to the left/right will change the FM station, Pandora song, (or other streaming song), while a long press will lower the volume. Overall, this wireless speaker is one of the best speakers I?ve bought. Don?t let it?s small size deter you. The sound quality is way much better than I expected. What are you waiting for? If you?re looking for a small and amazing wireless speaker, I highly recommend this one!

As expected, simple, convenient charge too.
For the price and considering the size , it?s simply amazing. For most music is sounds clear and full. Doesn?t have deep base but it?s way better than I expected.
Worked perfect, came charged and fit like a glove. Thank you very much.
Works great no issues so far and we practically keep our TV on all day.
Looking at the airport they wanted $16 for one of these. So I went on my amazon app ordered it and had it in 2 days. Works great and convenient for travel when my husband and I want to watch the same movie.
Always Resets and you need to go through Assistance screen every time.  Extremely frustrating,
Bought these for my daughters birthday, she is really pleased with them. They do everything that Bose claim. The main reason she wanted them was when she flys, great she says no engine noise from the plane.
Not bad quality for the price., a bit difficult to get the connectors in securely, doesn?t look like it could take too much force to pull cables out.
I love the sound ! Excellent bass & treble. Recommended
wouldn?t recommend it or buy a next one had to return
Never got the bloody thing to work. Not only did I waste money buying it, but I even feel ripped by the electricity it took to charge it.
Awsome product and you can do it without going online or anything! I especially love that it doesn?t take batteries (:
Works the first couple times but just stopped after about a week. NEVER Buy these if you want to keep you device charged
Housing looked very close to the original but would not fit. I considered swapping out the housing but the connector needed to be replaced as well and the wire connection method was different between the two.  Ordered from E&E Electronics.
Terrible, broke within the first day. Does not have a plug. It uses 6 &#34;AA&#34; batteries. The display does not stay illuminated. It only comes on when a button is pushed.
I am a manatee that wears pink earbuds  don?t judge. Hey, it was the cheapest color.. They are ok but no bass at all. My clear ones ( MEElectronics M6CLMEE Sport NoiseIsolating InEar Headphones with Memory Wire) I bought on Amazon sound better and had multiple ear pieces which this one didn?t come with. But overall these JVC ones are good for working out or running when you need them to stay in place, just don?t expect amazing sound quality.
Doesn?t seem to matter where I am at, I can only get one channel. I would look for another product!
Great sound and looks awesome!
Excellent product
works great! have bought before and have never had an issue, we just have s***ty wiring in our walls that crap out when it rains.
worked well for a long time
Very impressed with the sound quality of this device. It is a convenient size for travel and I love it!
Good buy
So far I have found this power supply to be excellent! As a physics tutor this power supply has made many of my labs/demonstrations much easier to perform.
Great product and all of the adapters you need to connect to just about anything!
I got this product discounted in exchange of a review. I really like this speakers, I bought them mainly for the waterproof function and it works well. I?d like it to be a little louder but I love the bass!
I bought this product from Amazon last year, because I wanted to try the 24bit A/D conversion. (I don?t notice any difference between 16bit and this.)  After very little use, the changer mechanism froze in the open position.  We found that the mechanism could be shut by depressing a pin inside the changer, but it would no longer play CDs.  I called Yamaha, and they told me I could send it to a service center in Bayshore, NY.  That is about 100 miles from my house. Tough luck, customer.  Yamaha does not pay for shipping in either direction.  So I spent close to $50 to send the product via UPS and back.  Yes, they fixed it, but I don?t know for how long. The wise ass who called to say it was ready accused me of forcing the drawer shut.  Of course, I had to force the drawer shut, otherwise, there was no way to send it for repair. I am not happy about the difficulty obtaining warranty service. I find the pause feature to be unsatisfactory.  If I leave it on pause for longer than a few minutes (I am not exactly sure for how long), pressing the button again will start the CD from the beginning, instead of where it was when I pressed pause. Next time I will avoid Yamaha.
very happy with this product! very high quality and efficient product!  the support from the swimbuds team has been outstanding and i can?t recommend the products highly enough.
Soft  leather and perfectly holds the Bose sport headphones. Durable and classic looking.
It works right out of the box. No programming, no nothing. Just needs two AAA batteries, press the power button, and huzzah! the TV turns on.
Wrong cord
I bought it for my trip to Portugal and worked perfectly. 100% recommended!
Horrible sound.  Power button stopped working after two months and wouldn?t take a charge.  Sharper Image (&#34;We don?t really make these...&#34;) would not fulfill the &#34;Satisfaction Guaranteed or Full Refund&#34; promise that is clearly stated twice on the item description page, but when I called Amazon, I was able to get a replacement shipped to me at no cost. Stay away!
Good quality and doesn?t take a ton of heat to melt the glue.
excelent
I love these not sure why anyone would complain. Lite weight and they totally cancel out all noise!
They didn?t last 3 months. Wish I would have checked when the return date was.
One of the best outdoor portable speakers bought!! For it?s price it?s amazing and how heavy duty it is.
Had to remove case to use these. Not quite as narrow as the description claims.
I also added a 25ft extension and it still worked
This is a well made, compact and easy functioning product bought for camper use so I could split my HDMI cable input from the Direct TV box to my TV, then turn off the power to that TV and have the signal go to another TV in the bedroom.  It worked perfectly and is easily changed with the push of a button.  The resultant picture quality is not affected by the split from this box.
I charged it fully as soon as I got it. It worked beautifully until I needed to charge it again. Now it wont charge and will play for about 30 seconds and then it dies. This is not a good product. Such a waste of money.
These are absolutely incredible. I installed them in my loft. Drilled right into concrete. The instructions are incredibly clear and simple. I have big speaker and they are held easily. Simple, effective.
Doesn?t work at all. Tried on other tvs and nothing. Good thing it was so inexpensive.
New floppys in a box. Just like I expected.
Great product for the road warrior.  I carry it with me daily as it also has a USB charger.  Like that it folds compactly (for a power unit) by plugging in the plug to the outlet.
I am extremely pleased with the product.
As far as I know, this Cable should work fine.  I probably will never know because  the Antenna to which it was connected would not work, at least, I couldn?t get it to, and the maker of the Antenna (their tech support) wasn?t any help.  Money down the drain for a cable and an antenna.
It did not work with my Samsung S4 phone trying to interface to a 1996 Maxima. I tried it with Torque and OBD Car Doctor. I don?t know if the problem is with the software or hardware. My previous OBD2 works fine.
wrong cable
This cord was shipped immediately upon ordering and arrived sooner than expected. It is a fairly heavy weight cord. I currently have a fridge and freezer connected to it with no concern. I compared the prices to the local big box store and found this to be less expensive and for the matching length.
Great wall Mount for the price easy to assemble it did what it advertised. I put it up in a corner of my office to hold my 24 inch flat screen tv and it was a  perfect fit and heavy duty.
For the price, these are really good headphones.  I recommend this to my friend.
Inserted the cable into the HD7 DJ and turned to lock it in place, only to have the silver protective cover break off. Not well made at all.
A little bulkier than I would have liked. Not ideal for travel due to is bulky size. It?s does work and I do like the dual USB ports and versatility. Seems as though when hooked to 220 that it does not regulate the power very well as I had to disconnect my iPad from it as it was causing issues. Once detached, iPad performance was fine. Charges better in the 1amp port.
The cups on the headphones are abit small. they barley fit around my ears. and i have average ear size.
